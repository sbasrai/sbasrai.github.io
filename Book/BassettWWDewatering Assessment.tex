\section*{Dewatering Assessment}
\begin{enumerate}


\item  What can be a problem with a belt filter press? \\

a. Washing out \\
b. Polymer overdosing \\
c. Blinding \\
*d. All of the above \\

\item  Which one of the following statements is TRUE in regard to the operation of a belt filter press: \\

a. Unlike a gravity belt, cationic polymers need not be used to condition the feed sludge to this unit. \\
b. When dewatering a mixture of WAS and primary sludge, which has been anaerobically digested, the operator can expect to produce a sludge cake with 22\% TS to 25\%. \\
*c. The best belt speed for this unit is the slowest speed the belt can be operated at, without causing “washout.” \\
d. Colloidal solids are likely to cause plugging of belt pores and thus cause “belt binding.” \\

\item  What can be used to evaluate the efficiency of a belt filter press? \\

a. Vacuum required in inches of mercury \\
b. \% volatile solids in cake \\
c. Sludge feed rate in gpd \\
*d. Filter yield in lbs/hr/sq ft \\
e. Gph of filtrate removal. \\

\item  An increase in the pool depth of a scroll-type centrifuge: \\

a. would not affect the moisture content of the cake. \\
b. would produce a drier cake \\
*c. would produce a wetter cake, but produce a greater solids recovery. \\
d. would not affect either solids recovery, nor cake moisture content. \\
e. would require an increase in the cationic polymer dosage. \\

\item  What can be used to evaluate the efficiency of a belt filter press? \\

a. Vacuum required in inches of mercury \\
b. \% volatile solids in cake \\
c. Sludge feed rate in gpd \\
*d. Filter yield in lbs/hr/sq ft \\
e. gallons-per-hour of filtrate removal. \\




\item You are assigned to supervise the operation ofa belt filter press.  Anerobically digested sludge - a mixture of primary and secondary sludge is being dewatered. Lab records show that this belt press routinely produces a sludge cake having a total solids concentration of 16.5\%. No other lab tests are run on the belt press. Answer the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item Are you satisfied with the dryness of the cake? Why or why not? Explain your answer.
\item List three (3) variables you could adjust to optimize the BFP. Explain how these adjustments affect the optimization of this unit. 
\item List two (2) other lab tests that must be performed in order to better monitor the operation,of the BFP
