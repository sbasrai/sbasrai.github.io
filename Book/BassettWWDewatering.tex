\chapter{Solids Dewatering}



        \begin{itemize}
        	\item Dewatering, like thickening does not treat the sludge but it allows for a reduction in sludge volume by removing water.  
        	\item Thickening achieves about 10\% or less solids content while dewatering is typically for increasing the solids content to between 15 to 30 percent. 
        	\item Sludge is dewatered to make it easier to handle and to reduce costs associated with elements related to accomplishing the end objectives with the sludge – land application, composting, drying, incineration or landfill.
        	\item Dewatering involves conditioning the sludge with a polymer and subjecting it to a physical process such as belt filter press or centrifuge to remove the water. 
        	\item Reasons for sludge dewatering are:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Critical for sludge treatment options such as sludge drying and incineration.
					\item Reduction in the weight of solids to be hauled – reducing hauling cost.
					\item Reduction in the volume of sludge that needs to be handled
				\end{itemize}
			\item More common sludge dewatering methods include:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Belt Filter Press 
					\item Centrifuge
				\end{enumerate}
			\item These are both mechanical methods and involve physically removing free water
			\item Both these methods involve conditioning of sludge with a cationic polymer which flocculate the solids - separating it from the water

		\end{itemize}

\section{Belt Filter Press}\index{Belt Filter Press}

The belt filter press dewaters sludge by squeezing polymer conditioned sludge between a pair of belt filter fabric as these belts pass through a system of rollers. Belt filter press produces a dewatered product typically between 12\% to 35\% solids content.

\subsection{Principles of belt filter press operations}\index{Principles of belt filter press operations}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Belt filter press utilizes two endless, porous belts (generally 0.7 to 3 meter wide) made from a synthetic material
						\item Polymer flocculated sludge is first introduced on the horizontal \hl{gravity zone} of the press where free water is removed from the sludge by chicane assisted gravity filtration through the porous belt press fabric.
						\begin{center}
						\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Chicanes}\\
						Gravity Zone - Chicanes
						\end{center}
						\item From the gravity zone, the sludge enters the \hl{low pressure zone (wedge zone)} in which the sludge is prepared for the upcoming \hl{high-pressure zone} by evenly distributing the solids across the belt and gradually applying pressure
						\item In the high pressure zone the sludge is sandwiched between two belt press fabrics. As the belts with the sandwiched sludge passes over and under 6 to 12 tensioning rollers which progressively decrease in diameter.  The applied pressure squeezes the water out from the sludge and is removed through the porous fabric.
						\item The filtrate is returned back to the front of the plant.
						\item The belts are washed continuously as they pass over \hl{wash boxes}.  The wash boxes are equipped with rotating brushes and water sprays and are primarily for keeping the belt press fabric pores open so water could easily filter through.  
						\item Improper polymer dosage and excessive hydraulic loading can lead to a wetter sludge cake.
						\item The belts are operated at speeds that commensurate with the rate of solids loading and the type of sludge being dewatered. Lower belt speed would allow for better water removal.  However, if if the belts speed is below the threshold for that particular sludge, belt press \hl{washout}, which is characterized by sludge flowing over the sides of the belt can occur .  Thus, the best belt speed is the slowest speed the belt can be operated without causing washout.
						\item The belts can be blinded - loose its porosity causing the water to stagnate/cause washout and not filter through, if excessive polymer is used or due ineffective belt washing.
						\item \hl{Solids capture rate} and \hl{Percent cake solids} produced are the most important belt press efficiency measurement parameters

\section{Centrifuge}\index{Centrifuge}
			The centrifuge dewaters the sludge by subjecting a polymer conditioned sludge to strong centrifugal forces by rotating it in a bowl at high speeds.  Centrifuges are used for dewatering solids in many different applications and wastewater solids dewatering being one them.  Centrifuges also come in different configurations.  The scroll conveyor (decanter) centrifuge is the more commonly used centrifuge design for wastewater sludge dewatering.  It produces a dewatered product typically between 20\% to 30\% solids content.  It should be noted that the centrifuge can also be utilized for sludge thickening.

				\begin{itemize}
					\item The bowl of the centrifuge is cylindrical shaped with a tapered cone at one end.  The bowl is designed to rotate at speeds of 1200 to 2400 RPM.

							Centrifuge Scroll
						\end{center}
					\item The polymer conditioned sludge is fed into the cylindrical portion of the bowl through a central feed pipe.  Inside the bowl, the sludge is subjected to intense G forces around 3000 Gs by virtue of the bowl rotating at a high speed. 
					\item As the bowl rotates, the water in the flocculated sludge is separated from the solids .  
					\item The scroll rotates at a 5 to 15 rpm differential speed from the bowl.  This differential speed causes the thickened  sludge to be propelled  along the bowl for towards its conical end.  As the sludge is screwed up the cone it emerges from the liquid at the beach, is drained and pushed up to discharge ports.  
					\item The separated water is discharged from the cylindrical (non-conical) end of the bowl.  The depth of the water - \hl{pond depth}, is controlled by adjustable weirs at the discharge end.
					\item The greater the pond depth improves the centrate quality and solids recovery but it reduces the drainage zone at the \hl{beach} end resulting in wetter solids.  The pond depth is altered using adjustable weirs.
					\item The centrate is returned back to the front of the plant
