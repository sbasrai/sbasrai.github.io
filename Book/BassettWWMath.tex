\section{Fractions}\index{Fractions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A fraction is defined as part of whole.  If in a class there are 20 male students and 30 male students, the fraction of male students is $\dfrac{20}{50} or \dfrac{2}{5}$.
\item It is composed of three items: two numbers and a line.
\item The number on the top is called the numerator, the number on the bottom is called the denominator, and the line in between them means to divide. 
$$
\text { Divide } \longrightarrow \dfrac{3}{4} \quad \begin{aligned}
&\text { Numerator } \\
&\text { Denominator }
\end{aligned}
$$
\item A proper fraction is a fraction that has no whole number part and its numerator is smaller than its denominator. An improper fraction is a fraction that has a larger numerator than denominator and it represents a number greater than one.\\
Proper Fraction Examples: $\dfrac{1}{2}$, $\dfrac{5}{8}$, $\dfrac{11}{12}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Improper Fraction Examples: $\dfrac{12}{2}$, $\dfrac{5}{2}$
\item Any whole number can be expressed as a fraction by placing a "1" in the denominator. For example:

2 is the same as $\dfrac{2}{1}$ and 45 is the same as $\dfrac{45}{1}$

\item Only fractions with the same denominator can be added/subtracted, and only the numerators are added/subtracted. For example:
$$
\dfrac{1}{8}+\dfrac{3}{8}=\dfrac{4}{8}  \enspace  \text {and},  \enspace \dfrac{7}{8}-\dfrac{3}{8}=\dfrac{4}{8}
$$

\item A fraction combined with a whole number is called a mixed number. For example:
$$
4 \dfrac{1}{8}, \enspace 16 \dfrac{2}{3}, \enspace  8 \dfrac{3}{4}, \enspace  45  \dfrac{1}{2} \text { and, } 12\dfrac{17}{32}
$$
These numbers are read, four and one eighth, sixteen and two thirds, eight and three fourths, forty-five and one half, and twelve and seventeen thirty seconds.\\
Mized numbers 

\item A fraction can be changed by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number. This does not change the value of the fraction, only how it looks. For instance:
$$
\dfrac{1}{2} \text { is the same as } \dfrac{1}{2} \times \dfrac{2}{2} \text { which is } \dfrac{2}{4}
$$

\item Steps to convert $\dfrac{17}{4}$ to a mixed number:
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item How many times can 4 fit into 17? 4 because 4×4=16.  Thus, 4 becomes the whole number part
\item How much is left over in the numerator? 1 because $17-16=1$.  Thus, 1 becomes the numerator of the fractional part
\item $\dfrac{17}{4} = 4\dfrac{1}{4}$
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item To turn a mixed number into an improper fraction, multiply the whole number part by the denominator and add the numerator. This becomes the new numerator over the original denominator.

Example: Converting 1.5 feet to fraction\\
$1.5ft=1\dfrac{1}{2}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$1\dfrac{1}{2}=\dfrac{1*2+1}{2}=\dfrac{2+1}{2}=\dfrac{3}{2}$
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item A mixed value - say a circumference is given in feet and fraction of feet (say $7 \enspace 3/4$), needs to be converted to a fraction for calculation purposes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ratio}\index{Ratio}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ratio is used for comparing the size of two or more quantities.
\item Say if there are 10 red cubes and 5 pink marbles in a bag, the ratio $\dfrac{5}{10}$ is the ratio of pink marbles and red cubes.  It can also be represented by 5:10.
\item 5 lbs of chemical in 10 gallons solution is a ratio.  So is 30 miles per gallon.
\item Unlike fractions, ratio does not compare things that have the same units.
\end{itemize}
\section{Proportion}\index{Proportion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two quantities are said to be in proportion if one changes, the other changes in a specific way.
\item Two quantities are said to be directly proportional, if the \textbf{increase} in one will \textbf{increase} the other value proportionally.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Thus, if two quantities x and y are directly proportional, its ratio $\dfrac{x}{y}$ will be a fixed value. Thus for x$_1$ and y$_1$ different values of x and y respectively will be related by the equation $\dfrac{x}{y}=\dfrac{x_1}{y_1}$.  

\item This relationship is useful for calculating unknown values in water treatment calculations as in the following example: \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Knowing 200 lbs of bleach is needed to disinfect 5 MG of water at a treatment plant, calculate the lbs of bleach required to disinfect 3.2 MGD flow.\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

The ratio $\dfrac{200 \enspace pounds \enspace bleach}{5 MG}$ or 40 lbs bleach per MG is a constant.  
Using this known proportion the lbs of bleach is needed to disinfect 3.2 MG at this plant can be calculated as follows by setting up the equation as:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\dfrac{40 \enspace pounds \enspace bleach}{MG}=\dfrac{X}{3.2 \enspace MG}$ where X is the unknown lbs of bleach that is required to disinfect the 3.2 MG flow.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
X can be calculated by cross multiplying the above equation: $X=\dfrac{3.2*40}{1}=128 \enspace lbs \enspace bleach$
\end{itemize}
\item Two quantities are said to be inversely proportional if the \textbf{increase} in one will \textbf{decrease} the other value proportionally.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Thus, if two quantities x and y are inversely proportional, its product $x * \text{y}$ will be a fixed value and different values of x and y respectively will be related by the equation $x *y = x_1 * y_1$.
\item Examples of inversely proportional relationship include:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Labor hours required to perform a certain task or time required to pump down a wetwell depending on the size of the pump.  An increase in assignment of labor hours will reduce the time required to perform the task 
\item Using a larger pump will reduce the time to pump down the wetwell.  
\item In the Pounds formula:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$$lbs \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace \dfrac{lbs}{day}=Concentration\Big(\frac{mg}{l}\Big)*8.34*volume(MG) \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace Flow (MGD)$$\\
 
\vspace{0.2cm}

for the same lbs or lbs/day, concentration varies inversely with volume or flow.  Thus, for a certain pounds added, the concentration will go down if the flow increases and vice versa.
\item In the flow equation, Q=V*A, for the same flow (Q), velocity (V) and surface area (A) are inversely related.  If Q is remaining the same, an increase in surface area will reduce the velocity and vice versa.\\

Additionally, for a flow through a pipe as the surface area of the pipe is proportional to the square of the diameter, the velocity in the pipe is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter.\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

For a constant Q:  $V *A = V_1 *A_1$ or $V *D^2 = V_1 *D_1^2$

\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2cm}


\vspace{0.2cm}

\item Application of inversely proportional relationship in water related calculation can be demonstration with the following example:

If it takes 20 minutes to pump a wet well down with one pump pumping at 125 gpm, then how long will it take if a 200 gpm pump is used?

As this is an inversely proportional relationship ( a larger pump will reduce the time required):\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$(20 \mathrm{minutes} * 125 \mathrm{gpm})=(X \mathrm{minutes} * 200 \mathrm{gpm})$ \\

where X is the unknown time to pump down the wetwell with the 200 gpm pump.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solving for X: $X=\dfrac{20*125}{200}=12.5 \enspace \mathrm{minutes}$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Decimals \& Powers of Ten}\index{Decimals \& Powers of Ten}
\begin{itemize}
\item A decimal is composed of two sets of numbers: the numbers to the left of the decimal are whole numbers, and numbers to the right of the decimal are parts of whole numbers, a fraction of a number.\\

\item The term used to express the fraction component is dependent on the number of characters to the right of the decimal.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first character after the decimal point is tenths: $0.1$ - tenths

  \item The second character is hundredths: $0.01$ - hundredths

  \item The third character is thousandths: $0.001$ - thousandths
\end{itemize}

\item Powers of 10 notation enables us to work with these very large and small quantities efficiently.
\item In water math, the most common application of this concept is related to parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb).
\item 1 million - 1,000,000 can be represented as 10$^6$.  Likewise, 1 billion - 1,000, 000,000 can be represented as 10$^9$
\item The sequence of powers of ten can also be extended to negative powers.
\item 1 part per million (1/1,000,000) can be written as 10$^-6$
\end{itemize}

\section{Rounding and Significant Digits}\index{Rounding and Significant Digits}

\begin{itemize}
\item Significant digits (also called Significant Figures) are digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement and are related to rounding.
\item This concept is used to determine the direction to round a number (answer). The basic idea is that no answer can be more accurate than the least accurate piece of data used to calculate the answer.\\
\item Significant digits is the count of the numerals in a measured quantity (counting from the left) whose values are considered as known exactly, plus one more whose value could be one more or one less.\\
\item Rules for determining the number of significant digits:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All nonzero digits are significant:\\
1.234 g has 4 significant figures, and 1.2 g has 2 significant figures.
\item Zeroes between nonzero digits are significant:
1002 kg has 4 significant figures, 3.07 mL has 3 significant figures.
\item Zeroes to the left of the first nonzero digits are not significant; such zeroes merely indicate the position of the decimal point:
\SI{0.001}{\celsius} has only 1 significant figure, 0.012 g has 2 significant figures.
\item Zeroes to the right of a decimal point in a number are significant:
0.023 mL has 2 significant figures, 0.200 g has 3 significant figures.
\item When a number ends in zeroes that are not to the right of a decimal point, the zeroes are not necessarily significant:
190 miles may be 2 or 3 significant figures, 50,600 calories may be 3, 4, or 5 significant figures. The potential ambiguity in the last rule can be avoided by the use of standard exponential, or ”scientific,” notation. For example, depending on whether 3, 4, or 5 significant figures is correct, we could write 50,600 calories as: $5.06*10^4$ calories (3 significant figures) $5.060*10^4$ calories (4 significant figures), or
$5.0600*10^4)$ calories (5 significant figures).
\end{enumerate}
\item Examples of significant figures:

\hline
\scriptsize{1000 has   one significant digit: only the 1 is interesting (only it tells us anything   specific); we don't know anything for sure about the hundreds, tens, or units   places; the zeroes may just be placeholders; they may have rounded something   off to get this value.                                    } \\ \hline
\scriptsize{1000.0 has five significant   digits: the ".0" tells us something interesting about the presumed   accuracy of the measurement being made; namely, that the measurement is   accurate to the tenths place, but that there happen to be zero tenths.                                                               } \\ \hline
\scriptsize{0.00035 has two significant   digits: only the 3 and 5 tell us something; the other zeroes are   placeholders, only providing information about relative size.                                                                                                                                                    } \\ \hline
\scriptsize{0.000350 has three significant   digits: the last zero tells us that the measurement was made accurate to that   last digit, which just happened to have a value of zero.                                                                                                                                         } \\ \hline

\scriptsize{560. : notice that   "point" after the zero!

\scriptsize{560.0 has four significant   digits: the zero in the tenths place means that the measurement was made   accurate to the tenths place, and that there just happen to be zero tenths;   the 5 and 6 give useful information, and the other zero is between   significant digits, and must therefore also be counted.} \\ \hline

\item Addition and Subtraction\\
\begin{itemize}
\item When you are \hl{adding or subtracting} a bunch of numbers and need to be concerned with significant figures, first add (or subtract) the numbers given in their entire format, and then round the final answer. \hl{When rounding the final answer after adding or subtracting, the answer must be written with the same significant figures as the least accurate decimal place given}.\\
\textbf{Example:} 13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38\\
\begin{itemize}
\item 13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38 = 261.2290\\
\item 234.6 is only accurate to the tenths place making it the least accurate number. My answer must be rounded to the same place as the least accurate number:\\
\item 261.2290 rounds to 261.2 (one decimal place)\\
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Multiplication and Division\\
\begin{itemize}
\item When \hl{multiplying or dividing} multiple numbers you would do these calculations as normal. When the answer must be written in the appropriate significant figure your answer must \hl{round to the same number of significant figures as the least number of significant figures.}\\
\textbf{Example 1:}  Simplify, and round, to the appropriate number of significant digits \\
\begin{center}
16.235 x 0.217 x 5\\
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item First off, 5 has only one significant figure, thus the final answer needs to be rounded to one significant digit\\
\item 16.235 x 0.217 x 5 = 17.614975\\
\item To round 17.614975 to one digit. I'll start with the 1 in the tens place. Immediately to its right is a 7, which is greater than 5, so 1 is rounded up to 2, and then replacing the 7 with a zero, and dropping the decimal point and everything after it.
\item 17.614975 rounds to 20\\
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Example 2:}  Simplify, and round, to the appropriate number of significant figures\\
\begin{center}
0.00435 x 4.6
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item 4.6 has only 2 significant figures, so the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.
\item 0.00435 x 4.6 = 0.02001\\
\item 0.02001 would round to 0.020, which has 2 significant figures (0.020). The answer cannot be 0.02, because that value would have only one significant figure.\\
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{A number is rounded off by dropping one or more numbers from the right and adding zeroes, if necessary, to maintain the decimal point.} 
\item \emph{If the last figure dropped is 5 or more, increase the last retained figure by 1. If the last digit dropped is less than 5, do not increase the last retained figure.}
\end{itemize}


\section{Averages}\index{Averages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Also known as \emph{arithmetic mean}, this value is arrived at by adding the quantities in a series and dividing the total by the number in the series.
\end{itemize}
Example 1: Find the average of the following series of numbers: 12,8,6,21,4,5 , 9 , and 12.\\
Adding the numbers together we get 77.\\
There are 8 numbers in this set.\\
Divide 77 by 8.\\

$\frac{77}{8}=9.6$ is the average of the set\\

Example 2:  Find the average of the set of daily turbidity data - 0.3,0.4,0.3,0.1,and 0.8\\
The total is 1.9.\\
There are 5 numbers in the set.\\
Therefore:
$$
\frac{1.9}{5}=0.38, \text { rounding off }=0.4
$$

\section{Working with Percent}\index{Working with Percent}
\begin{itemize}
\item Percent expresses portions of the whole.  
\item \texthl{The whole is considered as 1 or 100\% and a part of the whole can be expressed as a percent.}
\textbf{Example:} If a tank is $1 / 2$ full, we say that it contains $50 \%$ of the original solution.
\item Percentage is written as a whole number with a \% sign after it. 
\item In a calculation, percent is expressed as a decimal. 
\item \texthl{The decimal form of a percent value is obtained by dividing the percent by 100.}\\
 \textbf{Example:} $11 \%$ is expressed as the decimal $0.11$, since $11 \%$ is equal to $11 / 100$. This decimal is obtained by dividing 11 by 100.
\item \texthl{To determine what percentage a part is of the whole, divide the part by the whole.}\\
\textbf{Example:} There are 80 water meters to read, Jim has finished 24 of them. What percentage of the meters have been read?\\
$$24 \div 80=0.30$$\\
The $0.30$ is converted to percent by multiplying the answer by 100.\\
$$0.30 \times 100=30 \%$$\\
Thus $30 \%$ of the 80 meters have been read.\\

\item \texthl{To find the percentage of a number, multiply the number by the decimal equivalent of the percentage given in the problem.}\\
\textbf{Example:}\\
What is $28 \%$ of $286 ?$\\

\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item Change the $28 \%$ to a decimal equivalent:  $$28 \% \div 100=0.28$$
\item Multiply $286 \times 0.28=80$\\
Thus $28 \%$ of 286 is 80.
\end{enumerate}

\item \texthl{To increase a value by a percent, add the decimal equivalent of the percent to " 1 " and multiply it times the number.}

\textbf{Example:} A filter bed will expand $25 \%$ during backwash. If the filter bed is 36 inches deep, how deep will it be during backwash?\\

\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item Change the percent to a decimal.
$$
25 \% \div 100=0.25
$$
\item Add the whole number 1 to this value.
$$
1+0.25=1.25
$$
\item Multiply times the value.
$$
36 \text { in } \times 1.25=45 \text { inches }
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Percentage Concentrations}
Above concepts are used for chemicals such as fluoride and hypochlorites - the strength of the product as used is commonly expressed as a percentage.

\textbf{Example 1:} A chlorine solution was made to have a $4 \%$ concentration. It is often desirable to determine this concentration in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. This is relatively simple: the $4 \%$ is four percent of a million.

To find the concentration in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ when it is expressed in percent, do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change the percent to a decimal.
\end{enumerate}
$$
4 \% \div 100=0.04
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Multiply times a million.
\end{enumerate}
$$
0.04 \times 1,000,000=40,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}
$$
We get the million because a liter of water weighs $1,000,000 \mathrm{mg} .1 \mathrm{mg}$ in 1 liter is 1 part in a million parts ( $\mathrm{ppm}) .1 \%=10,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$.


\textbf{Example 2:} How much $65 \%$ calcium hypochlorite is required to obtain 7 pounds of pure chlorine?\\
$65 \%$ implies that in every lb of calcium hypochlorite has $65 \%$ lbs of available chlorine.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Therefore, $\dfrac{0.65 \textrm{ lbs available chlorine}}{\textrm{lb of calcium hypochlorite}} $ or conversely $\dfrac{\textrm{lb of calcium hypochlorite}}{0.65 \textrm{ lbs available chlorine}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies{\textrm{lbs calcium hypchlorite required}}=\dfrac{\textrm{lb of calcium hypochlorite}}{0.65 \cancel{\textrm{ lbs available chlorine}}}*\dfrac{7\cancel{\textrm{ lb of available chlorine}}}{}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$=\boxed{10.8 \textrm{ lbs of calcium hypochlorite with } 65\%\textrm{available chlorine is required}}$

\section{Flow and Velocity}\index{Flow and Velocity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Flow Rate - Q (volume/time) = velocity (distance or length traveled /time) * surface area
\item Velocity is the speed at which the water is flowing.  It is measured in units of length/time – ft./sec.
\item Velocity of water flowing through can be calculated by dividing the flow rate by area of the flow stream.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
$$Velocity \enspace \dfrac{length}{time}= \dfrac{flow \enspace rate(\dfrac{volume \enspace or \enspace cubic \enspace length}{time})}{surface \enspace area \enspace in \enspace the \enspace direction \enspace of \enspace flow-square \enspace length}$$
\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{For a flow in a pipe:}\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{VelocityinPipe}\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 1:} If a chemical is added in a pipe where water is flowing at a velocity of 3.1 feet per second, how many minutes would it take for the chemical to reach a point 7 miles away?  \\

Note - we want the answer in minutes\\

$$\textrm{Min } = \dfrac{1}{3.1}\dfrac{sec}{ft}*\dfrac{5280ft}{mile}*7 miles*\dfrac{min}{60 sec} = \boxed{199 min}$$
\\

\textbf{Example 2:} Find the flow in cfs in a 6 -inch line, if the velocity is 2 feet per second.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the cross-sectional area of the line in square feet. Start by converting the diameter of the pipe to inches.

The diameter is 6 inches: therefore, the radius is 3 inches. 3 inches is $3 / 12$ of a foot or $0.25$ feet.

\item Now find the area in square feet.
$$
\begin{aligned}
&A=\pi \times r^{2} \\
&A=\pi \times\left(0.25 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\right. \\
&A=\pi \times 0.0625 \mathrm{ft}^{2} \\
&A=0.196 \mathrm{ft}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
Or
$$
\begin{aligned}
&A=0.785 \times D^{2} \\
&A=0.785 \times 0.5^{2} \\
&A=0.785 \times .05 \times .05 \\
&A=0.196 \mathrm{ft}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

\item Now find the flow.

$\mathrm{Q}=\mathrm{V} \times \mathrm{A}$

$\mathrm{Q}=2 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec} \times 0.196 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$

$\mathrm{Q}=0.3927 \mathrm{cfs}$ or $0.4 \mathrm{cfs}$
\end{enumerate}


\section{Concentration}\index{Concentration}
\begin{itemize}
\item Concentration is typically expressed as mg/l which is the weight of the constituent (mg) in 1 liter of water.
\item As 1 liter of water weighs 1 million mg, a concentration of 1 mg/l implies 1 mg of constituent per 1 million mg of water or one part per million (ppm).   \texthl{Thus, mg/l and ppm are synonymous.}
\item Sometimes the constituent concentration is expressed in terms of percentage.\\
\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Example:} 12.5\% chlorine concentration solution.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
100\% would mean 1,000,000 mg/l or 1,000,000 ppm\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies$1\% would be $\dfrac{1,000,000}{100}\textrm{mg/l} = \textrm{10,000 mg/l or 10,000 ppm}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies$12.5\% chlorine concentration is 125,000 mg/l or 125,000 ppm.
\vspace{6pt}

$1\% \enspace concentration = 10,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace\dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$0.1\% \enspace concentration = 1,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$0.01\% \enspace concentration = 100 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$10\% \enspace concentration = 100,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$5\% \enspace concentration = 50,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$12.5\% \enspace concentration = 125,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
\end{itemize}

\section{Density}\index{Density}
\begin{itemize}
\item Density is defined as the weight of a substance per a unit of its volume. For example, pounds per cubic foot or pounds per gallon.

\item Here are a few key facts about density:
\begin{itemize}

\item Density is measured in units of lb/ft3, lb/gal, or mg/L. Density of water = 62.4 lb/ft3 = 8.34 lb/gal.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Gravity}\index{Specific Gravity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance (liquid or solid) to the density water.
\item It is the ratio of the weight of the substance of a certain volume to the weight of water of the same volume.

\item Any substance with a density greater than that of water will have a specific gravity greater than 1.0. Any substance with a density less than that of water will have a specific gravity less than 1.0. 

\item Specific gravity examples:
\begin{itemize}

\item Specific gravity of water = 1.0 
\item Specific gravity of concrete = 2.5 (depending on ingredients)
\item Specific gravity of alum (liquid @ 60°F) = 1.33 
\item Specific gravity of hydrogen peroxide (35\%) = 1.132
\end{itemize}

\item Specific gravity is used in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To calculate the total weight of a \% solution (either as a single gallon or a drum volume).\\
Total Weight = Drum Vol X SG X 8.34
\item To calculate the “active ingredient” weight of a single gallon or a drum.\\

Active Ingredient Weight within Drum = Drum Volume X SG X 8.34 X \% solution as a decimal. (i.e., Total Weight X \% solution as a decimal)\\

NOTE: Both ways start with solving for the total weight (Drum Vol X SG X 8.34). When solving for “active ingredient” weight, you have to then multiply by \% solution as a decimal.

\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} What is the weight of 5 gallons of a 40\% ferric chloride solution given its specific gravity of 1.43?
$$(8.34 * 1.43) \enspace lbs/gal*5 \enspace gallons = \boxed{59.6 \enspace lbs}$$

The weight of active ferric chloride in the drum will be 59.6*0.4=23.84 lbs (as ferric chloride is 40\% strength)

\section{Detention Time}\index{Detention Time}
\begin{itemize}
\item \colorbox{lime}{Detention Time} - The actual or theoretical (calculated) time required for water to fill a tank at a given flow; pass through a tank at a given flow; or remain in a settling basin, flocculating basin, rapid-mix chamber, or storage tank.\\

Rectangular tank/clarifier volume = width * length * depth of water\\
Circular tank/clarifier volume = 0.785 * Diameter$^2$ * depth of water\\

\section{Unit Conversions}\index{Unit Conversions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A conversion is a number that is used to multiply or divide into a measure in order to change the units of the original measure.

    \end{tabular}
 \caption{Common units in water calculations}	
    \end{center}

    \end{table}

\item In most instances, the conversion factor cannot be derived. It must be known. Therefore, tables such as the one below are used to find the common conversions.\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Some Common Conversions & Weight \\

\vspace{0.2cm}
\item Common conversions in water related calculations include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item gpm to cfs

  \item Million gallons to acre feet

  \item Cubic feet to acre feet

  \item Cubic feet of water to gallons


  \item gpm to MGD 

  \item psi to feet of head

\end{itemize}

\item Steps for unit conversion:\\
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1:]
\item \texthl{Make sure the original unit is for the same measurement as the converted (desired) unit.}  So if the original unit is for area, say in ft$^2$ the converted unit should be another area unit such as in$^2$ or acre but it cannot be gallons as gallon is a unit of volume.\\
Note:  Calculating the weight of a certain volume of water involves the use of density which is the mass per volume -  value in units including lbs/gallon or lbs/$ft^3$\\

\item Write down the conversion formula as:\\

$Quantity \enspace in \enspace converted \enspace unit = Quantity \enspace (\cancel{Original \enspace Unit}) *   Conversion  \enspace Factor \enspace  \dfrac{Conversion \enspace unit}{\cancel{Original \enspace unit}}$\\
\end{enumerate}

\item Note:  If you wish to convert cubic feet of water to pounds, you have to use its density which is the known mass per unit volume.\\
$\dfrac{8.34 \enspace lbs}{gallon}$ or $\dfrac{62.4 \enspace lbs}{ft^3}$\\
$mass \enspace of \enspace water = \cancel{Volume} *   Density  (\dfrac{mass}{\cancel{Volume}})$\\

\end{itemize}

Example Problems:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert 1000 $ft^3$ to cu. yards\\

$1000 \cancel{ft^3}*\dfrac{cu.yards}{27\cancel{ft^3}} = 37 cu.yards$

\item Convert 10 gallons/min to $ft^3$/hr\\
Note:  This involves use of two conversion factors - one for converting gallons to cubic feet and another for converting minute to gallons.\\ 
$\dfrac{10 \cancel{gallons}}{\cancel{min}}*  \dfrac{ft^3}{7.48 \cancel{gallons}}  * \dfrac{60 \cancel{min}}{hr}   = \dfrac{80.2ft^3}{hr}$


\item Convert 100,000 $ft^3$ to acre-ft.\\
$100,000 \cancel{ft^3} * \dfrac{acre-ft}{43,560 \cancel{ft^2-ft}} =  2.3 acre-ft$\\

\item Convert 8 $ft^3$ of water to pounds.\\
Here the conversion is from a volume ($ft^3$) to a weight (lbs).  It involves use of a standard correlation of the volume of water to its weight - its density. 

$Weight \enspace of \enspace water \enspace in \enspace lbs=8 \cancel{ft^3} *   62.4  (\dfrac{lbs}{\cancel{ft^3}}) = 499.2 \enspace lbs $\\

\end{enumerate}

\section{Pounds Formula}



Pounds formula is used for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculating the quantity in pounds of a particular wastewater constituent entering or leaving a wastewater treatment process
\item Calculating the pounds of chemicals to be added\\
\end{itemize}
So if the concentration of a particular constituent (in mg/liter) and the volume or flow of wastewater is given, one can calculate the amount of that constituent in pounds using the following – Pounds Formula:
$$lbs \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace \dfrac{lbs}{day}=concentration(\dfrac{mg}{l})*8.34*volume(MG) \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace flow(\dfrac{MG}{day}(MGD)$$

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{PoundsFormula}
\end{center}
\caption{Pounds formula "nomograph"}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.3cm}
There are three variables – (lbs, concentration and volume) and one constant (8.34) in the pounds formula.  Knowing any of the two variables in the formula, one can calculate the third (unknown) variable by rearranging the equation.
\subsection{Example Problems}
% \hl{Example Problems}\\
\begin{enumerate}

\item If the influent wastewater flow is 5 MGD and the BOD concentration is 240 mg/l what is the daily BOD loading in lbs/day?\\
Solution:\\
$\dfrac{lbs \enspace BOD}{day}=5MGD*240mg/l*8.34=\boxed{\dfrac{10,000lbs}{day}}$\\

\item Calculate the lbs of solids in the primary sludge if the sludge flow is 7500 gallons and the solids concentration is 4.5\%.\\
Solution\\
Applying lbs formula:\\
$lbs \enspace solids = \dfrac{7500 \enspace MG}{1,000,000} * 4.5*10,000 *8.34 = \boxed{2,815 \enspace lbs \enspace solids}$\\
\textbf{Note:}\\  
1) 7500 gallons was converted to MG by dividing by 1,000,000\\
$7500 \enspace gallons * \dfrac{1 MG}{1,000,000 \enspace gallons}$\\
2) 4.5\% was converted to mg/l by multiplying by 10,000 as 1\%=10,000mg/l

\item An operator dissolves 1,200 lbs of a chemical in 12,000 gallons of water, what is the resultant concentration in mg/l, of the chemical solution?\\
Solution:\\
$Concentration \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}=\dfrac{lbs}{Volume \enspace MG \enspace * \enspace 8.34}$\\
$Concentration \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}=\dfrac{1,200}{0.012 \enspace * \enspace 8.34}=\boxed{\dfrac{11,990 \enspace mg}{l} \enspace or \enspace 1.2\% \enspace solution}$\\
\textbf{Note:}\\  
1) 12,000 gallons was converted to MG by dividing by 1,000,000\\
$12,000 \enspace gallons * \dfrac{1 MG}{1,000,000 \enspace gallons}$\\
\end{enumerate}
\section{Process Removal Efficiency Calculations}\index{Process Removal Efficiency Calculations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Process removal rate or removal efficiency is the percentage of the inlet concentration removed.  
\item It is used for quantifying the pollutant removal during wastewater treatment and is established based upon the amount of a particular wastewater constituent entering and leaving a treatment process.

\item $Process \enspace Removal \enspace Rate \enspace (\%) = \dfrac{Pollutant \enspace  In-Pollutant\enspace  Out}{Pollutant \enspace In}*100$\\

\item If 10 units of a pollutant are entering a process and 8 units of pollutant are leaving (process removes 2 units), then the process removal rate for that pollutant is (10-8)/10*100=20\%.  In this example the process is 20\% efficient in removing that particular pollutant.

\item The amount of pollutant can be measured in terms of concentration (mg/l) or in terms of mass loading (lbs).  The pounds formula is used for calculating the mass loadings.  
\end{itemize}
The above example is for calculating the removal efficiency using the inlet and outlet concentrations or mass loading.\\
The methods below can be used for calculating either the inlet or outlet pollutant concentrations, if the removal efficiency and the corresponding inlet or outlet concentrations are given.

$$lbs \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace \dfrac{lbs}{day}=Concentration\Big(\frac{mg}{l}\Big)*8.34*volume(MG) \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace Flow (MGD)$$\\
\item So if the concentration of a particular constituent (in mg/liter) and the volume or flow of wastewater is given, one can calculate the amount of that constituent or using this formula.\\
\texthl{Important notes:}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texthl{The unit of the constituent loading rate will be in lbs per the unit of time the flow is expressed in.  So if the flow is in MG per day the calculated loading rate will be in lbs/day.  Likewise if the flow value used is in MG per minute, the calculated loading rate will be in lbs/min.}
\item \texthl{If volume is used, the calculated value will be the mass of the constituent in that volume.  If flow is used, the calculated value will be the mass of the constituent in that flow.}
\item \texthl{For the Pound Formula to work, the volume or flow needs to be expressed in MG.  Volume or flows in other units - gallons, $ft^3$ etc. needs to be converted to MG.}
\end{enumerate}

\item The formula assumes that all of the material found in water (TSS, BOD, MLSS, Chlorine, etc.) weighs the same as water, that is, $8.34$ pounds per gallon.
\item In the Pounds Formula, there are three variables – lbs, concentration and volume, and one constant - 8.34.  Knowing any of the two variables in the formula, one can calculate the third (unknown) variable by rearranging the equation.\\

\textbf{Example 1:} If a 5 MGD flow is to be dosed with 25 mg/l of a certain chemical, calculate the lbs/day that chemical required.\\

Solution\\

Applying lbs formula:\\
$\dfrac{lbs}{day}=5 MGD *250\dfrac{mg}{l}*8.34 = \boxed{1,042\dfrac{lbs}{day}}$

$lbs chemical = \dfrac{7500}{1,000,000}MG * 4.5*10,000 *8.34 = \boxed{2,815 \enspace lbs \enspace chemical}$\\
\textbf{Note:}\\  
1) 7500 gallons was converted to MG by dividing by 1,000,000\\
$7500 \enspace gallons * \dfrac{1 MG}{1,000,000 \enspace gallon}$\\
2) 4.5\% was converted to mg/l by multiplying by 10,000 as 1\%=10,000mg/l


\section{Chemicals Related Math Problems}\index{Chemicals Related Math Problems}
\subsection{Chemical Dosing}\index{Chemical Dosing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use lbs formula to calculate the lbs of chemicals required\\
\item Using the calculated lbs chemical required value, calculate the amount of that chemical at the concentration available
\end{itemize}

So for example, if asked how much many gallons per day of bleach solution (SG 1.2)containing 12.5\% available chlorine is required to disinfect a 10 MGD flow of water given the required chlorine dosage of 7 mg/l.\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item calculate the lbs of chlorine required using the lbs formula:\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
=$10 MGD \enspace * \enspace 7 \dfrac{mg}{l} \enspace * \enspace 8.34\enspace=\enspace 583.8 \enspace lbs \enspace chlorine \enspace per \enspace day$\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item calculate the gallons of bleach which will provide the 583.8 lbs chlorine\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Applying the lbs formula - note that 8.34 * SG will give the actual lbs/gal of bleach.  If SG is not provided, use only 8.34 lbs per gallon:\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
$583.8 \dfrac{lbs \enspace bleach}{day}\enspace=\enspace x \dfrac{gal}{day} \enspace * \enspace 8.34 * 1.2 \dfrac{lbs \enspace bleach}{gal} \enspace * \enspace 0.0125 \dfrac{lbs \enspace chlorine}{lb \enspace bleach} \enspace $\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
$ \implies x \dfrac{gal}{day}\enspace = \enspace \dfrac{583.8}{8.34*1.2*0.125} \enspace = \boxed{467 \dfrac{gal}{day}}$
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{The above problem can be solved directly using the formula below given in the SWRCB Water Treatment Exam Formula Sheet.}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
 $\textrm{GPD}=\dfrac{\textrm{(MGD)}*\textrm{(ppm or mg/l)}*8.34 \enspace \textrm{lbs/gal}}{\textrm{\% \enspace purity}*\textrm{Chemical \enspace Wt. (lbs/gal)}}$ 
 \vspace{0.3cm}
 $\textrm{GPD}=\dfrac{10*7*8.34}{0.125*(1.2*8.34)}=\boxed{467 \dfrac{\textrm{gal}}{\textrm{day}}}$ 
 
\subsection{Chemical Dilution} \index{Chemical Dilution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Chemicals obtained in bulk are typically delivered in higher concentrations to reduce transportation costs and need dilution to ensure proper mixing and dosage control.

\item Thus, for dilution calculations, if:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
C$_1$ and V$_1$ is the concentration and volume respectively of the concentrated chemical used for the dilution, and\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
C$_2$ and V$_2$ is the concentration and volume of the product after dilution with water\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
As, the mass of the target chemical in the volume of the concentrated product used for dilution will remain the same in the final diluted product:\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{C$_1$ * V$_1$ =  C$_2$ * V$_2$.}\\

\item Thus, knowing C$_1$, C$_2$ and V$_2$, we can calculate V$_1$ as: $$V_1 = \frac{C_2 * V_2}{C_1}$$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Problem:}\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
How much initial volume of a 4\% polymer solution is needed to make 3500 gallons of polymer at 0.25\% concentration.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$$V_{4\%} = \frac{C_{.25\%} * V_{.25\%}}{C_{4\%}} = \frac{0.25 \enspace * \enspace 3500}{4}= 219 gal $$ 
\vspace{0.2cm}
So take 219 gallons of the 4\% polymer and dilute to 3500 gallons to give a 0.25\% polymer solution.

\section{Primary Treatment} \index{Primary Treatment}
\subsection{Hydraulic or Surface Loading Rate}\index{Hydraulic or Surface Loading Rate}

The hydraulic or surface loading rate measures how rapidly wastewater moves through the primary clarifier.  It is measured in terms of the number of gallons flowing each day through one square foot surface area of the clarifier. 
$$Clarifier \enspace hydraulic \enspace loading \enspace 	\Big(\dfrac{gpd}{ft^2}\Big) =\dfrac{Clarifier \enspace influent 	\enspace flow (gpd)}{Clarifier \enspace surface \enspace area 	(ft^2)}$$ 
		Rectangular clarifier surface area  = width * length\\
		Circular clarifier surface area  = 0.785 * Diameter$^2 $\\
\subsection{Detention Time}\index{Detention Time}

Detention time is the length of time that wastewater stays in the settling tank is called the detention time.  It is also the time it takes for a unit volume of wastewater to pass entirely through a primary clarifier\\
$$Clarifier \enspace detention \enspace time \enspace (hr) = 	\dfrac{ Clarifier \enspace volume (cu.ft \enspace or \enspace gal)}{Influent \enspace flow \enspace (cu.ft \enspace or \enspace gal)/hr)}$$
Rectangular clarifier volume = width * length * depth of water\\
Circular clarifier volume = 0.785 * Diameter$^2$ * depth of water\\
Typically volume is calculated in cu. ft and influent flow is given in gallons.  Use 7.48 gal/ft$^3$ conversion factor to convert volume in cu. ft to gallons.\\

\subsection{Weir Overflow Rate}\index{Weir Overflow Rate}
The weirs at the end of the primary clarifier allow for the even distribution of the the outlet flow across the entire length of the weir.  An adequate length of weir is needed to ensure smooth and even flow of wastewater over the weirs.  Weir overflow rate measures the number of gallons of wastewater per day flowing over one foot of weir. 

		$$Weir \enspace over \enspace flow \enspace rate \Big(\dfrac{gpd}{ft}\Big) =\Big(\dfrac{Clarifier \enspace influent \enspace  flow (gpd)}{Total \enspace effluent 					\enspace weir \enspace length \enspace (ft)}\Big)$$
		Circular clarifier weir length = 3.14 * Diameter\\

\hl{Example problem for (a), (b) and (c) above:}\\
		\vspace{0.2cm}
A circular clarifier receives a flow of 11 MGD.  If the clarifier is 90 ft. in diameter and is 12 ft. deep, what is: a) the hydraulic/surface loading rate, b) clarifier detention time in hours, and c) weir overflow rate?\\
		\vspace{0.2cm}
a) Hydraulic/surface loading rate:\\
$Clarifier \enspace hydraulic \enspace loading \enspace 	\Big(\dfrac{gpd}{ft^2}\Big) ==\dfrac{\dfrac{11\cancel{MG}}{{day}}*\dfrac{10^6gal}{\cancel{MG}}}{0.785*90^2 ft^2}=\boxed{1,730gpd/ft^2}$\\
		\vspace{0.5cm}
b) Clarifier detention time:\\
$Clarifier \enspace detention \enspace time \enspace (hr) = 	\dfrac{ Clarifier \enspace volume (cu.ft \enspace or \enspace gal)}{Influent \enspace flow \enspace (cu.ft \enspace or \enspace gal)/hr)}$\\
		\vspace{0.2cm}
$Clarifier \enspace detention \enspace time \enspace (hr) = 	\dfrac{(0.785*90^2*12)\cancel{ft^3}}{\dfrac{11\cancel{MG}}{\cancel{day}}*\dfrac{10^6\cancel{gal}}{\cancel{MG}}*\dfrac{\cancel{ft^3}}{7.48\cancel{gal}}*\dfrac{\cancel{day}}{24hrs}}=\boxed{1.2hrs}$\\
		\vspace{0.5cm}
c) Weir overflow rate:\\
		\vspace{0.2cm} 
$Weir \enspace overflow \enspace rate \Big(\dfrac{gpd}{ft}\Big) =\dfrac{\dfrac{11\cancel{MG}}{{day}}*\dfrac{10^6gal}{\cancel{MG}}}{3.14*90 ft}=\boxed{38,924gpd/ft}$\\

\subsection{Removal Efficiency}\index{Removal Efficiency}		
Primary sedimentation removes suspended wastewater solids which includes BOD.  The efficiency of the primary is established as the percentage of the amount of parameter removed.  The parameter may quantified as mass (lbs) or as concentration (mg/l).

$$Removal \enspace efficiency (\%) = \dfrac{Parameter  \enspace In - Parameter  \enspace Out}{Parameter \enspace In} * 100$$

For TSS removal:\\
$$TSS \enspace Removal \enspace efficiency (\%) = \dfrac{TSS  _{In} \enspace(mg/l)  - TSS_{Out} \enspace(mg/l)  }{TSS _{In} \enspace(mg/l)  } * 100$$

For BOD removal:\\
$$BOD \enspace Removal \enspace efficiency (\%) = \dfrac{BOD_{In} \enspace(mg/l)  - BOD_{Out} \enspace(mg/l)  }{BOD _{In} \enspace(mg/l)  } * 100$$
\subsection{Solids Removal}\index{Solids Removal}	

\hl{\textbf{Type 1 Problems:}  These involve calculating lbs of solids removed given any two of the following TSS parameters - inlet concentration, outlet concentration and removal efficiency.}\\
a. If the inlet and outlet concentrations are given, calculate the mg/l of TSS removed using: 
$$TSS_{removed} = TSS_{in}(mg/l) - TSS_{out} (mg/l) $$
Then knowing the flow, use the lbs formula to calculate the lbs solids removed.

b. If either inlet or outlet concentration is given along with the clarifier removal efficiency, using the removal efficiency calculate the unknown outlet concentration (if only the inlet is given) or the inlet concentration (if only the outlet is given)\\
i) If inlet and removal efficiency is given, calculate the outlet by subtracting the product of inlet and removal efficiency from the inlet.
$$TSS_{out}=TSS_{in} - (TSS_{in}*\%Removal)$$
Example if the removal efficiency is 60\% and the inlet concentration is 300mg/l: $$TSS_{out}=300 - 300*0.6=120mg/l$$
ii) If outlet and removal efficiency is given, calculate the inlet concentration by dividing the outlet by (1-removal efficiency).\\
$$TSS_{in}=\dfrac{TSS_{out}}{1-\%Removal}$$
Example if the removal efficiency is 60\% and the outlet concentration is 120mg/l: $$TSS_{in}=\dfrac{120}{1-0.6}=300mg/l$$ 

Note:  You may derive the above formulas by algebraically manipulating: $\%Removal=\dfrac{TSS_{in} -TSS_{out}}{TSS_{in}}$\\
\hl{Example Problem:}\\
How many lbs of solids are removed daily by a primary clarifier treating a 6 MGD flow if the average influent TSS concentration is 300 mg/l and the clarifier TSS removal efficiency is 67\%.\\
$TSS_{out}=(300mg/l - 300*0.67)=99mg/l$\\
$lbs \enspace solids \enspace  removed = (300-99)mg/l*8.34*6MGD=\boxed{10,058 \enspace lbs \enspace solids \enspace removed \enspace per \enspace day}$\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\hl{\textbf{Type 2 Problems:}  These involve calculating the amount of sludge pumping given the solids removed.  The solids removed from the primary clarifier is sludge with a typical solids concentration of about 3\% to 5\%.}\\
Given the amount of total solids removed and given the sludge concentration, the volume of sludge pumping can be calculated as follows:  $$\dfrac{ft^3\enspace sludge\enspace pumped}{ day}= \dfrac{lbs \enspace solids \enspace (removed)}{day} * \dfrac{1 \enspace lb \enspace sludge}{(\%)\enspace lbs \enspace solids}*\dfrac{gal \enspace sludge}{8.34lb \enspace sludge}*\dfrac{ft^3 \enspace sludge}{7.48 \enspace gal} $$
So for the solids removed in the above example, if the primary sludge has 5\% solids, the required sludge pumping can be calculated as:
$$\dfrac{ft^3\enspace sludge}{day}= \dfrac{10,058 \enspace \cancel{lbs \enspace solids}}{day} * \dfrac{1 \enspace \cancel{lb \enspace sludge}}{0.05\enspace \cancel{lbs \enspace solids}}*\dfrac{\cancel{gal \enspace sludge}}{8.34\cancel{lb \enspace sludge}}*\dfrac{ft^3 \enspace sludge}{7.48 \enspace \cancel{gal}}=\boxed{3,224\dfrac{ft^3 \enspace sludge}{day}} $$

\end{itemize}
			\hl{Example Problem:}\\

\subsection{Organic Loading}\index{Organic Loading}

			\begin{itemize}
\item Organic loading to a trickling filter is typically expressed as lbs BOD/(day-1000 cu ft).  \item The lbs/day BOD value is the BOD loading from the primary effluent.
\item The 1000 ct. ft is the volume of the media.  
\item The media volume is calculated by multiplying the TF surface area by the media height.  
\item As the dimensions are typically given in ft., calculate the volume in $ft^3$ and then divide the calculated volume by 1000 to give the volume in units of 1000$ft^3$\\
\end{itemize}
\hl{Example Problem:}\\
A trickling filter, 70 ft in diameter with a media depth of 6 ft, receives a flow of 0.78 MGD. If the BOD concentration of the primary effluent is 167 mg/L, what is the organic loading on the trickling filter in lbs BOD/day/1000 cu ft?\\
Solution:  $Organic \enspace loading:\dfrac{lbs \enspace BOD}{day-1000ft^3}=\dfrac{lbs \enspace BOD \enspace feed \enspace to \enspace TF \enspace per \enspace day}{volume \enspace in \enspace 1000ft^3}$\\
$=\dfrac{\dfrac{(0.78*167*8.34)lbs \enspace BOD}{day}}{(0.785*70^2*6)ft^3*\dfrac{1000ft^3}{1000ft^3}}=\boxed{\dfrac{47 lbs \enspace BOD}{day-1000 ft^3}}$

\vspace{0.2cm}
\item A trickling filter has a total flow of 32 MGD.  If the recirculation ratio is 0.8, what is the primary effluent flow to the TF?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Total \enspace Flow (Q_T) = Influent \enspace Flow (Q_I)*(Recirculation \enspace Ratio(R_R) +1)$\\

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Key Points for Solving MCRT Problems}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{MLSS quantification}:\\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item Pounds formula is used to calculate lbs MLSS using: i) aeration tank and the clarifier volumes, and ii) the given MLSS concentration.  
\item The MLSS concentrations for the aeration tank and the clarifier are the same.  So the given MLSS concentration applies to both - the aeration tank and the clarifier
\item Make sure it is the MLSS concentration that you are using not the MLVSS concentration.  
\item If MLSS concentration is not given but instead MLVSS concentration is given, you will need to find the MLSS concentration by dividing the MLVSS conc. by the mixed liquor volatile solids, as MLVSS(conc.) = MLSS * \% volatile solids
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Suspended solids quantification}:\\ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Effluent suspended solids}
\begin{itemize}
\item Effluent suspended solids can be quantified using the pounds formula - using the effluent flow (in MGD) and the effluent suspended solids concentration.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{WAS suspended solids}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use pounds formula given the WAS flow (make sure it is in MG) and the WAS SS concentration
\item Note that the WAS and RAS streams have the same SS concentration.  If WAS SS concentration is not specified, use the RAS SS concentration
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The plant has two  aeration tanks – 0.45 MG volume each and two final clarifiers – 0.2 MG volume each, and a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration averages  1800 mg/l.   The effluent suspended solids concentration averages 18 mg/L. The WAS flow is 100,000 gallons per day has a SS concentration of 6100 mg/L. Calculate the MCRT\\

\item The F:M may be used to determine the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids to be maintained in the aeration tank.
\item Generally, low F/M ratios should be carried during the colder months as the microorganism activity (metabolism) is lower.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Key Points for Solving F:M Problem}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Quantifying F:}
\begin{itemize}
\item use the pounds formula to calculate the lbs/day of BOD in the primary effluent.\\
lbs/day BOD = Primary eff. flow (MGD)* Primary eff. BOD concentration (mg/l) * 8.34\\
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantifying M:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The concentration of the microorganisms is assumed to be the same as the MLVSS concentration
\item \textbf{Only the mass of the microorganisms (MLVSS) in the aeration basin is used – the mass of microorganisms in the secondary clarifier is not considered} 
\item lbs MLVSS may be calculated using pounds formula using the volume of the aeration tank (in MG) and the MLVSS concentration
\item If the MLVSS concentration is not given, it can be calculated from the MLSS and MLSS \% volatile matter (solids) concentration\\
MLVSS = MLSS * \% MLSS volatile solids
\end{itemize}


\hl{Example Problem:}\\
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item A conventional activated sludge plant receives an average flow of 5.5 MGD. The influent BOD to the plant averages 230mg/l and the primary effluent BOD average 160 mg/l. The 1 MG aeration tank has an MLSS concentration of 2800 mg/L and the MLVSS volatile solids content is 75\%. Calculated the F:M ratio for this plant.
\vspace{0.3cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
F=5.5*160*8.34=7339lbs/day BOD\\
M=1*2800*0.75*8.34=17514lbs MLVSS\\
F:M=$\dfrac{7339}{17514}=\boxed{0.41}$\\

Note:  The 160 mg/l BOD concentration of the primary effluent was used for the F calculation and not 230mg/l - which is the BOD concentration of the flow coming into the plant\\
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Sludge Volume Index (SVI)}\index{Sludge Volume Index (SVI)}

\begin{itemize}
\item SVI measures the settleability and compactibility of the secondary sludge
\item It is calculated using results from the 30-minute settleability test and the MLSS concentration
\item SVI is expressed in ml/g and it is essentially the volume (ml) of 1 gram of the MLSS after 30 minutes of settling
\item it provides a more accurate picture of the sludge settling characteristics than settleability or MLSS alone
\item 50 to 120 ml/gm SVI value is considered
optimal. Higher SVI values indicate sludge that is slow to settle and not compacting well. When SVI
values are approaching 200 ml/gm, activated sludge process is considered to be "bulking".
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
SVI (ml/g)= $\dfrac{Settled \enspace sludge \enspace volume \enspace in \enspace ml/l \enspace after \enspace 30 \enspace min}{MLSS \enspace mg/l}*1000 \dfrac{mg}{g}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Key Points for Solving SVI Problems}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item For the settling test MLSS is typically settled in a 1 liter settleometer.  The volume of the settled solids is therefore read as ml/L.  So if for any reason a larger or smaller volume of the mixed liquor sample is taken, the settle solids value should commensurate with the volume of the MLSS sample.  For example, if a 2 liter settleometer is used and if the solids settle to 400 ml in that settleometer, the ml/L will be 400ml/2L or 200ml/L
\item For some problems, the settled solids volume is provided as a percentage (\%).  So if a 1-liter settlometer is used and the settled solids volume is reported as 25\%, it implies a settled sludge volume of 250ml/L
\end{itemize} 
\hl{Example Problem:}\\
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item In an aeration tank, the MLSS is 2500 mg/l and recorded 30-minute settling test indicates 230 ml/L.  What is the sludge volume index?\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
Solution:\\
SVI=$\dfrac{230ml/l}{2500mg/l}*1000\dfrac{mg}{g}=\boxed{92ml/g}$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}

\item An activated sludge plant operates well at an F:M ratio of between 0.23 and 0.28.  Calculate the minimum MLSS concentration, given the following:\\
Q = 0.4 MGD\\
Primary influent BOD = 250 mg/l\\
Primary effluent BOD = 128 mg/l\\
Aeration tank vol. = 350,000 gallons\\
Clarifier vol = 250,000 gallons\\
MLSS has 80\% volatile solids\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
$F:M=\dfrac{(lbs/day) \enspace primary \enspace effluent  \enspace BOD \enspace entering \enspace the  \enspace aeration \enspace tank}{(lbs) \enspace MLVSS \enspace in \enspace the  \enspace aeration \enspace tank}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
$\implies F:M \propto \dfrac{1}{MLSS \enspace concentration}$  $\implies$ F:M is inversely proportional to MLSS\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
So to have minimum MLSS conc. F:M needs to be the maximum of the range provided\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
If the MLSS concentration = x:
$ \implies F:M=0.28=\dfrac{0.4*128*8.34}{0.35*x*0.8}\implies x = \boxed{5,446 mg/l \enspace MLSS}$

\\

 \vspace{0.2cm}
C$_3$ and and V$_3$ is the concentration and volume (flow) respectively of the digester sludge feed\\

Also, any of the three volume variables can be expressed as the sum or difference of the other two - , or V$_1$ + V$_2$ = V$_3$ or V$_1$ = V$_3$ - V$_2$ or V$_2$ = V$_T$ - V$_1$\\

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}) \times$ Flow $(\mathrm{MGD}) \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 4 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=167 \mathrm{lb} /$ day

\textbf{Example 2 :}\\
A pipeline that is 12 inches in diameter and $1400 \mathrm{ft}$ long is to be treated with a chlorine dose of $48 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. How many lb of chlorine will this require?

First determine the gallon volume of the pipeline:

Volume $(\mathrm{gal})=0.785 \times \mathrm{D}^{2} \times$ length $(\mathrm{ft}) \times 7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{cu} \mathrm{ft}$

Volume $(\mathrm{gal})=0.785 \times(1 \mathrm{ft})^{2} \times 1400 \mathrm{ft} \times 7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{cu} \mathrm{ft}$ Volume $(\mathrm{gal})=8221 \mathrm{gal}$

Next calculate the amount of chlorine required:

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})$ x Flow $($ MGD) $\times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=48 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 0.008221 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=3.3 \mathrm{lb}$

\textbf{Example 3:}\\
A water sample is tested and found to have a chlorine demand of $1.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. If the desired chlorine residual is $0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$, what is the desired chlorine dose (in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ )?

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=$ Chlorine Demand $+$ Chlorine Residual

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=1.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}+0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Chlorine $\operatorname{Dose}(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=2.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

\textbf{Example 4:}\\
The chlorine dosage for water is $2.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. If the chlorine residual after a 30-minute contact time is found to be $0.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$, what is the chlorine demand (in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ )?

Chlorine Demand $=$ Chlorine Dose $-$ Chlorine Residual

Chlorine Demand $=2.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}-0.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Chlorine Demand $=2.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

\textbf{Example 5:}\\
What should the chlorinator seting be (lb/day) to treat a flow of $2.35 \mathrm{MGD}$ if the chlorine demand is $3.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ and a chlorine residual of $0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ is desired?

First, determine the chlorine dosage (in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ):

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=$ Chlorine Demand $+$ Chlorine Residual

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=3.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}+0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=4.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Next calculate the chlorine dosage (feed rate) in $\mathrm{lb} /$ day:

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}) \times$ Flow $(\mathrm{MGD}) \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=4.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 2.35 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=80.4 \mathrm{lb} /$ day


\textbf{Example 6:}\\
A chlorinator setting is increased by $2 \mathrm{lb} /$ day. The chlorine residual before the increased dosage was $0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. After the increased chlorine dose, the chlorine residual was $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. The average flow rate being chlorinated is $1.25 \mathrm{MGD}$. Is the water being chlorinated beyond the breakpoint?

First calculate the expected increase in chlorine residual:

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})$ x Flow $(\mathrm{MGD}) \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

$2 \mathrm{lb} /$ day $=\times \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 1.25 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

$x=2 /(1.25 \times 8.34)$

$\mathrm{x}=0.19 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Actual increase in residual is:

$0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}-0.19 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}=0.31 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

\textbf{Example 7:}\\
A chlorinator setting of $18 \mathrm{lb}$ chlorine per 24 hours result in a chlorine residual of $0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. The chlorinator setting is increased to $22 \mathrm{lb}$ per 24 hours. The chlorine residual increased to $0.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ at this new dosage rate. The average flow being treated is $1.4 \mathrm{MGD}$. On the basis of these data, is the water being chlorinated past the breakpoint?

First calculate the expected increase in chlorine residual:

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}) \times$ Flow $(\mathrm{MGD}) \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

$4 \mathrm{lb} /$ day $=\mathrm{x} \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 1.4 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

$\mathrm{x}=4 /(1.4 \times 8.34)$

$\mathrm{x}=0.34 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Next calculate the actual increase in residual:

$0.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}-0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}=0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

\section{Chemical dosing math problems}\index{Chemical dosing math problems}
\subsection{lbs chemicals needed given flow and dosing rate}\index{lbs chemicals needed given flow and dosing rate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use lbs formula to calculate the lbs of chemicals required\\
\item Using the calculated lbs chemical required value, calculate the amount of that chemical at the concentration available
\end{itemize}

So for example, if asked how much many gallons per day of bleach solution (SG 1.2)containing 12.5\% available chlorine is required to disinfect a 10 MGD flow of water given the required chlorine dosage of 7 mg/l.\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item calculate the lbs of chlorine required using the lbs formula:\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
=$10 MGD \enspace * \enspace 7 \dfrac{mg}{l} \enspace * \enspace 8.34\enspace=\enspace 583.8 \enspace lbs \enspace chlorine \enspace per \enspace day$\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item calculate the gallons of bleach which will provide the 583.3 lbs chlorine\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Applying the lbs formula - note that 8.34 * SG will give the actual lbs/gal of bleach.  If SG is not provided, use only 8.34 lbs per gallon:\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
$583.3 \dfrac{lbs \enspace bleach}{day}\enspace=\enspace x \dfrac{gal}{day} \enspace * \enspace 8.34 * 1.2 \dfrac{lbs \enspace bleach}{gal} \enspace * \enspace 0.0125 \dfrac{lbs \enspace chlorine}{lb \enspace bleach} \enspace $\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
$ \implies x \dfrac{gal}{day}\enspace = \enspace \dfrac{583.3}{8.34*1.2*0.125} \enspace = \boxed{466 \dfrac{gal}{day}}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Chemical batching and dilution}\index{Chemical batching and dilution}

These problems include questions such as:  \textit{How much initial volume of a 4\% polymer solution is needed to make 3500 gallons of polymer at 0.25\% concentration?}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item These type of problems are solved using C*V relationship where C is the concentration and V is the volume.

\item As C is expressed in weight/volume, C*V will equal to weight.  The weight of the chemical will be same before and after the dilution

\item If C$_1$ is the concentration of the chemical before dilution and V$_1$ is the volume of that initial concentration that is needed and C$_2$ is the final concentration that you want to make and V$_2$ is the volume that you are making of the final concentration, C$_1$ * V$_1$ = C$_2$ * V$_2$.

\item Knowing C$_1$, C$_2$ and V$_2$, we can calculate V$_1$ as: $$V_1 = \dfrac{C_2 * V_2}{C_1}$$

$$V_{4\%} = \dfrac{C_{.25\%} * V_{.25\%}}{C_{4\%}} = \dfrac{0.25 \enspace * \enspace 3500}{4}= 219 gal $$ 

Take 219 gallons of the 4\% polymer and dilute to 3,500 gallons to give a 0.25\% polymer solution.
