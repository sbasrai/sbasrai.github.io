\section{Steps in Solving Problems}
\section{Introduction}
There are many methods that can be successfully used to solve waterworks problems. We tend to select and adapt problem-solving styles that fit our individual system. If you have selected one or more methods that are beneficial to your style, we suggest that you continue to use what has worked in the past. However, if waterworks problems have frustrated you then we suggest that you consider some version of the following procedure:

\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When appropriate, make a drawing of the information in the problem.

  \item Place the data that is available on the drawing.

  \item Ask, "What is the question?"

  \item Write down what you are to find. Sometimes the answer has more than one piece. For instance, you may need to find " $X$ " and then find "Y."

  \item Write down any equation that you are going to need.

  \item Fill in the data in the equation.

  \item Rearrange the equation, if necessary.

  \item Pick up the calculator and make the calculation.

  \item Write down the answer.

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Word Problems}\index{Word Problems}
In word problems, certain words can be used to determine the correct math function or meaning. Here are a few of the basic word meaning examples:

Symbols to Words

In writing mathematical formulas or expressions,

\begin{tabular}{|ll|}
\hline
Word & Meaning \\
\hline

and & add \\
per & divide \\
less than & subtract \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

symbols are used to indicate an mathematical operation. Here are a few examples:

3 pi - Greek letter ( $\pi$ ) used as a symbol denoting the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. ${ }^{4} \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ (milligrams per Liter) - A unit of the concentration of a constituent in water. It is $0.001 \mathrm{~g}$ of the constituent in $1,000 \mathrm{ml}$ of water. $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ has replaced the PPM (parts per million) in reporting results in water.

\subsection{Help with Calculator}\index{Help with Calculator}
\section{Introduction}
The calculator has made the solution of waterworks problems much easier and improved our accuracy. At the same time the calculator brings with it its own problems. The following are few hints that may make using the calculator less stressful.

\subsubsection{Hint \#1 - Type of Calculator}
The calculator used by a waterworks operator is not a toy; it is a tool like any other tool. As such, it is best to purchase for quality rather than price. Quality will be easier to use and last much longer. A quality calculator used by a waterworks operator should have the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The keys should be large enough to allow your fingers to be easily placed on them.

  \item The calculator should have a $\mathbf{p i}^{3}(\pi)$ key. This makes calculating pipe and circular tank volumes much easier.

  \item Solar calculators do not offer the freedom of use that battery calculators offer.

  \item A protective case will add life to the calculator.

  \item The display should allow for 10 characters.

  \item A scientific calculator is more appropriate and useful than a business calculator.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hint \#2 - Read the Book}
The small booklet that comes with the calculator is designed to help you understand the functions of the calculator. You should read and then store the book for easy access. This allows you to use the book to help solve unique problems that show up only on occasion.

\subsubsection{Hint \#3 - Division by 2}
One of the common problems confronted by operators is the proper method to solve the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item One incorrect method that is used is to divide 7 by $0.25$ and then multiply that answer by $8.34$. This will yield an incorrect answer of $233.52 \mathrm{mg} / \mathbf{L}^{4}$.

  \item A second less serious mistake is to multiply $0.25 \times 8.34$ and write the answer down on a piece of scratch paper (2.085). Typically the answer is rounded off to 2 . The rounding reduces the accuracy, and writing the number down is a step that is not necessary.

  \item The CORRECT APPROACH would be to place 7 in the calculator, press the divide key $(\div)$, enter the number $0.25$ and press the divide key $(\div)$ again. Now enter in the number $8.34$, and press the equal key $(=)$. The correct answer of $3.357$ should be displayed. This can be rounded off to $3.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. Yes, this is one more character than the correct number of significant digits. This is done not because of accuracy but because the answer is most likely larger than 3 .

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Fractions}\index{Fractions}

With the calculators that are available today, the need to work with fractions is not what it once was. However, the operator is often faced with routine situations that require thinking in fractions and on occasion actually working with fractions. One of the common uses for the rules governing the use of fractions in a math problem is dealing with units of a problem. The unit gpm is actually a fraction gal/min, and $\mathbf{c f s}^{5}$ is actually $\mathrm{ft}^{3} / \mathrm{sec}$. So as you can see, understanding fractions may help you solve other problems.\\

A fraction is composed of three items: two numbers and a line. The number on the top is called the numerator, the number on the bottom is called the denominator, and the line in between them means to divide.\\
$$
\text { Divide } \longrightarrow \frac{3}{4} \quad \begin{aligned}
&\text { Numerator } \\
&\text { Denominator }
\end{aligned}
$$

\subsubsection{Principles of Working With Fractions}\index{Principles of Working With Fractions}
Like all other math functions, how we deal with fractions is governed by rules or principles. The following is a discussion of 11 principles associated with using fractions.

Same Numerator and Denominator

When the numerator and denominator of a fraction are the same, the fraction can be reduced to 1 . For example:
$$
\frac{4}{4}=1, \frac{24}{24}=1, \frac{8}{8}=1, \frac{12}{12}=1, \frac{125}{125}=1
$$

\subsubsection{Whole Numbers to Fractions}\index{Whole Numbers to Fractions}
Any whole number can be expressed as a fraction by placing a "1" in the denominator. For example:

2 is the same as $\frac{2}{1}$ and 45 is the same as $\frac{45}{1}$

\subsubsection{Adding Fractions}\index{Adding Fractions}
Only fractions with the same denominator can be added, and only the numerators are added. For example:
$$
\frac{1}{8}+\frac{3}{8}=\frac{4}{8} \text { and }, \frac{6}{32}+\frac{12}{32}=\frac{18}{32}
$$

\subsubsection{Subtracting Fractions}\index{Subtracting Fractions}
Only fractions with the same denominator can be subtracted, and only the numerators are subtracted. The denominator remains the same. For example:
$$
\frac{7}{8}-\frac{3}{8}=\frac{4}{8} \text { and, } \frac{18}{25}-\frac{6}{25}=\frac{12}{25}
$$

\subsubsection{Mixed Numbers}\index{Mixed Numbers}
A fraction combined with a whole number is called a mixed number. For example:
$$
4 \frac{1}{8}, \quad 16 \frac{2}{3}, 8 \frac{3}{4}, 45 \frac{1}{2} \text { and, } 12 \frac{17}{32}
$$
These numbers are read, four and one eighth, sixteen and two thirds, eight and three fourths, forty-five and one half, and twelve and seventeen thirty seconds.

\subsubsection{Changing a Fraction}\index{Changing a Fraction}
A fraction can be changed by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number. This does not change the value of the fraction, only how it looks. For instance:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \text { is the same as } \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{2} \text { which is } \frac{2}{4}
$$

Fractions should be reduced to their simplest terms. This is accomplished by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number. The result of this division must leave both the numerator and the denominator as whole numbers. For instance:
$$
\frac{2}{4} \text { is not in its simplest terms, } \frac{1}{2}
$$
The number $2 / 3$ cannot be reduced any further since there is no number that can be divided evenly into the 2 and the 3 .

\subsubsection{Practice Problems - Fractions}\index{Practice Problems - Fractions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Reduce the following to their simplest terms.\\
A. $4 / 8=$\\
B. $12 / 18=$\\
C. $3 / 4=$\\
D. $6 / 8=$\\
E. $24 / 32=$\\
F. $\quad 9 / 18=$\\
G. $15 / 27=$ Key to Reducing - Even Numbers
\end{enumerate}
When the starting point is not obvious, do the following: if the numerator and denominator are both even numbers $(2,4,6,8,10$, etc.), divide them both by 2 . Continue dividing by 2 until a division will no longer yield a whole number with the numerator and denominator.\\

Key to Reducing - Odd Numbers\\

When the numerator and denominator are both odd numbers $(3,5,7,9,11,13,15)$, attempt to divide by three, continue dividing by 3 until a division will no longer yield a whole number with the numerator and denominator. It is obvious that some numbers such as 5, 7, and 11 cannot be divided by 3 and may in fact be in their simplest terms.\\


To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, the denominators must be changed so that all denominators are the same. To find the "common denominator," multiply the denominators together. Then convert each fraction to a new value based on this new common denominator.\\

For instance, to add $1 / 8$ and $2 / 3$ together:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start by multiplying the denominators $8 \times 3=24$.

  \item Change $1 / 8$ to a fraction with 24 as the denominator.

\end{enumerate}
$$
\frac{24}{8}=3, \quad 3 \times 1=3 \text { (the numerator), new fraction is } \frac{3}{24}
$$
Notice that this is the same as $1 / 8$ except $3 / 24$ is not reduced to its simplest terms.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item Change $2 / 3$ to a fraction with 24 as the denominator.
\end{enumerate}
$$
\frac{24}{3}=8, \quad 8 \times 2=16 \text { (the numerator), new fraction is } \frac{16}{24}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
  \item Complete the addition.
\end{enumerate}
$$
\frac{3}{24}+\frac{16}{24}=\frac{19}{24}
$$


Any time the numerator is larger than the denominator, the fraction should be turned into a mixed number. This is accomplished by the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the number of times the denominator can be divided evenly into the numerator. This will be the whole number portion of the mixed number.

  \item Multiply the whole number times the denominator, and subtract from the numerator. This value, the remainder, becomes the numerator of the fraction portion of the mixed number.

\end{enumerate}
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{28}{12}, 28 \text { is divisible by } 12 \text { twice. } 2 \text { is the whole number } \\
&2 \times 12=24 \\
&\frac{28}{12}-\frac{24}{12}=\frac{4}{12} \text { dividing top and bottom by } 4=\frac{1}{3} \\
&\text { New mixed number is } 2 \frac{1}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$
Multiplying Fractions:\\

This is accomplished by the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Multiply the numerators together.

  \item Multiply the denominators together.

  \item Reduce to the simplest terms.

\end{enumerate}
For example: Find the result of multiplying $1 / 8 \times 2 / 3$
$$
\frac{1}{8} \times \frac{2}{3}=\frac{2}{24}, \text { reduced }=\frac{2}{24} \div \frac{2}{2}=\frac{1}{12}
$$
Dividing Fractions:\\

This is accomplished by the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Invert the denominator (turn it upside down).

  \item Multiply and reduce to simplest terms. For example:

  \item Divide $1 / 8$ by $2 / 3$.

\end{enumerate}
$$
\frac{1}{8} \div \frac{2}{3}=\frac{1}{8} \times \frac{3}{2}=\frac{1 \times 3=3}{8 \times 2=16}=\frac{3}{16}
$$
The divide symbol can be $\div$ or $/$ or $-$.

Converting Fractions to Decimals

To convert a fraction to a decimal, simply divide the numerator by the denominator.

Example - Converting Fractions to Decimals
$$
\frac{1}{2}=0.5, \frac{7}{8}=0.875, \frac{7}{16}=0.875, \frac{1}{4}=0.25, \text { and } \frac{2}{3}=0.667
$$
Changing Inches to Feet

To change inches to feet, multiply the number of inches by the conversion $1 / 12$. Example - Changing Inches to Feet

Change 3 inches to feet:

3 in $x \frac{1 \mathrm{ft}}{12 \text { in }}=\frac{3 \text { ift } x 1 \mathrm{ft}}{12 \text { int }}=\frac{3 \mathrm{ft}}{12}=0.25 \mathrm{ft}$

Practice - Changing Inches to Feet

Change the following to feet:

2 inches, 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches

$\frac{2}{12}=0.167$ feet

$\frac{4}{12}=0.33$ feet

$\frac{6}{12}=0.5$ feet

$\frac{8}{12}=0.667$ feet

A decimal is composed of two sets of numbers: the numbers to the left of the decimal are whole numbers, and numbers to the right of the decimal are parts of whole numbers, a fraction of a number.\\

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \draw (0,0) node[circle, draw]{$\sum_{i=1}^{n}n^2$} -- (1,1) 
  node[rectangle,draw]{$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$};

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]

\end{tikzpicture}\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-10}\\
The term used to express the fraction component is dependent on the number of characters to the right of the decimal.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first character after the decimal point is tenths: $0.1$ - tenths

  \item The second character is hundredths: $0.01$ - hundredths

  \item The third character is thousandths: $0.001$ - thousandths

\end{itemize}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-10(1)}
\subsection{Arithmetic}\index{Arithmetic}

With today's use of calculators, we seldom need the rules for handling decimals. As a result, when we need to make a computation manually, we often cannot remember the basic rules. Therefore, this brief review is provided.\\

Number Less Than One\\

When a number is less than one and is expressed as a decimal, place a "0" (zero) to the left of the decimal. This makes it clear that the number is less than one. For instance $0.25$ is much clearer than 25.\\

When subtracting decimals, simply line up the numbers at the decimal, and subtract.\\

For example:\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-11}\\

To add numbers with a decimal, use the same rules as subtraction: line up the numbers on the decimal, and add.
$$
\begin{array}{r}
28.65 \\
12.25 \\
\hline 40.90
\end{array}+\begin{array}{r}
145.600 \\
13.212 \\
\hline 158.812
\end{array}
$$

To multiply two or more numbers containing decimals, follow these few basic steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Multiply the numbers as whole numbers. Do not worry about the decimals.

  \item Write down the answer.

  \item Count the total number of digits (numbers) to the right of the decimal in all of the numbers being multiplied.

  \item To place the decimal in the answer, count from the right to the left the number of digits counted in the previous step.

\end{enumerate}

Multiplying $3.04$ x $8.6$ yields the number 26144 .

There are a total of three digits to the right of the decimal point ( 2 for the number $3.04$ and 1 for the number 8.6). Therefore, the decimal point should be placed three places to the left from the right of the last 4 .\\

To divide a number by a number containing a decimal, the divisor must be made into a whole number by moving the decimal point to the right until you have a whole number.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Count the number of places the decimal needed to be moved.

  \item Move the decimal in the dividend by the same number of places.

  \item Make the division.

\end{enumerate}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-12}

Using the Calculator

With today's calculators, this problem would simply be set up as follows:
$$
\frac{346.2}{45.6}=7.59
$$




\subsection{Rounding and Significant Digits}\index{Rounding and Significant Digits}
Why Round?

Numbers are rounded to reduce the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. This is for convenience, not accuracy.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start by deciding how many places you want to the right of the decimal. Remember this is done for convenience.

  \item If the number to the right of the last number that you wish to report is 5 or greater than 5 , increase the size of the last number by 1 .

  \item If the number to the right of the last number that you wish to report is less than 5 , the size of the last number remains the same.

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Example 1 - Rounding}
A calculation has just been completed, and the answer is $24.55836$. A decision is made to have two places to the right of the decimal. Two places takes you to $25.55$. The next number is "8." Therefore, the last five is rounded up to a six. The number is $24.56$.

\subsection{Example 2 - Rounding}
A calculation has just been completed, and the answer is $24.55436$. A decision is made to have two places to the right of the decimal. Two places takes you to $25.55$. The next number is "4." Therefore, all of the numbers to the right of the $.55$ are dropped. The reported number is $24.55$.

\section{Practice Problems - Rounding}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Round the following to the nearest hundredths (the second place after the decimal).\\
A. $2.4568$\\
B. $27.2534$\\
C. $128.2111$\\
D. $364.8762$\\
E. $354.777777$\\

E. $354.777777$\\
F. $34.666666$\\
G. $67.33333$

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Determining Significant Digits}\index{Determining Significant Digits}
Significant digits are related to rounding. We use the concept to determine the direction to round a number. The basic idea is that no answer can be more accurate than the least accurate piece of data used to calculate the answer.\\

There are several rules used to determine whether a digit is significant:\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Non-zero digits are significant. ie. numbers $1-9$

  \item Zero's appearing between non-zero digits are significant. ie. 103, 24000.2, $10.7$

  \item Zero's appearing to the right of a decimal ar significant. ie. $12.00,8.3400,0.020$

  \item Zero's appearing at the beginning of a number are NOT significant. ie $\mathbf{0 . 4}$

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Practice Problems - Significant Digits}\index{Practice Problems - Significant Digits}
For addition and subtraction the process involves two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the number of decimal places in the least accurate piece of data.

  \item Round off the answer to theis position.

\end{enumerate}
Example - Significant Digits\\

The following calculation was made: The least accurate piece of data is number 12.27. As $12.27$ has only 2 decimal places the sum can have only 2 decimal places as well. The correct answer is 57.55.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Round the following answers off to the most significant digit.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
 & Problem & Accurate Answer \\
\hline
A. & $25.1+26.43=51.53$ &  \\
\hline
B. & $128.456-121.4=7.056$ &  \\
\hline
C. & $85-7.92432=77.07568$ &  \\
\hline
D. & $8.564+5=13.564$ &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

For multiplication and division the process involves two steps:\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the number of significant figures each number has.

  \item Round the final answer to the number with the least significant digits.

\end{enumerate}
Example - Multiplication and Division with Significant Digits\\
The following calculation was made:\\

$53.2 \times 128.64=6,843.648$

In the above problem, $53.2$ has 3 significant figures and $128.64$ has 5 . The multiplication/division rule says the answer should be rounded to the number with the least number of significant digits; in this case three (53.2). So the correct answer is 6,840 .\\

$2 .$\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
 & Problem & Accurate Answer \\
\hline
A. & $26.34 \times 124.34567=3,275.26495$ &  \\
\hline
B. & $23.58 \times 34.251=807.63858$ &  \\
\hline
C. & $12,453 / 13.9=895.8992805755$ &  \\

D. & $12,457.92 \times 3=37,373.76$ &  \\

${ }^{6}$ Area - The extent of a surface, measured by the number of squares of equal size it contains.

${ }^{7}$ Cubic Feet - A measurement of volume in the number of cubes that are one foot on a side.

\subsection{Powers}\index{Powers}
Powers are used to identify area ${ }^{6}$, as in square feet, and volume as in cubic feet ${ }^{7}$. Powers can also be used to indicate that a number should be squared, cubed, etc. This later designation is the number of times a number must be multiplied by itself.\\

Example - Powers\\

We could find these two numbers:

$4^{2}$ or $4 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$\\

The number $4^{2}$ means $4 \times 4=16$.\\

The number $4 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$ means four square feet, an area $2 \mathrm{ft} \times 2 \mathrm{ft}$.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-15}\\

Or we might see these two numbers $4^{3}$ or $4 \mathrm{ft}^{3}$.\\

The number $4^{3}$ means $4 \times 4 \times 4=64$.\\

The number $4 \mathrm{ft}^{3}$ means 4 cubic feet, a block $2 \mathrm{ft} \times 2 \mathrm{ft} \times 1$ foot deep.\\

The value is arrived at by adding the quantities in a series and dividing the total by the number in the series. bers and dividing by the number of numbers in the group. This is an activity that is required on the monthly report for chlorine, fluoride, and turbidity readings. The average for the month is commonly figured on all chemicals added, and on most test results. Example 1 - Averages

Find the average of the following series of numbers: $12,8,6,21,4,5$, 9 , and 12 . Adding the numbers together we get 77 . There are 8 numbers in this set. Divide 77 by 8 .

$\frac{77}{8}=9.6$ is the average of the set

\subsection{Equations}\index{Equations}
An equation is a symbolic representation of how to combine certain information in order to obtain the proper result. Equations are written using letters and symbols to represent unknown or standard values.\\


Equations (also called formulas) are used by operators to solve a wide variety of problems associated with treatment and collection. In fact, most operators use formulas without thinking about them to solve routine problems. For instance, to determine the perimeter or distance around a building requires using a formula.\\

Example 1 - Equations\\
The equation for determining the perimeter of a triangle is $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}+\mathrm{c}$. $\mathrm{P}$ is the letter used to designate the perimeter and $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}$, and $\mathrm{c}$ are used to identify the lengths of the sides. The mathematical symbols $(=)$ and $(+)$ tell the user what math functions are to be carried out. This formula says to add the lengths of all of the sides to obtain the perimeter.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-17}\\

Example 2 - Equations\\
In the example below, the numbers $3^{\prime}, 4^{\prime}$, and $5^{\prime}$ have been substituted for the letters a, b, and c. To solve the equation substitute the numbers for the appropriate letters, $a=3^{\prime}, b=4^{\prime}$, and $\quad \mathrm{c}=5^{\prime}$. Now add the three together to obtain a perimeter of $12^{\prime}$. The distance around this triangle is 12 feet.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-17(1)}\\

$4^{\prime}$\\


This equation will work for all triangles, regardless of the lengths of their sides.\\


Some equations such as the one for the area of a circle $\left(\mathrm{A}=\pi \mathrm{r}^{2}\right)$ use symbols. The symbol $\pi$ (pi) is used to represent a constant: 3.14. This is done in equations to simplify the writing of the equation.\\

A listing of common equations used in water/wastewater systems can be found at the end of this chapter. In addition, equations are used in most of the other sections of this chapter.\\

\subsubsection{Rearranging Equations}
Types of Equations

The equations that are commonly used in water math are called linear equations (follow a straight line). To be successful in solving math problems, an operator must be able to solve a linear equation with one unknown (perimeter of a triangle, pounds formula, area of a circle are all examples of this type of equation).\\


To solve a problem, an operator is often required to solve the equation for a component that is not normally part of the solution. For instance, the perimeter and the length of two sides of a triangle may be known, and you wish to solve for the length of the third side.\\

Equations have two sides that are separated by the equal sign $(=)$. To solve an equation, there must be only one unknown and the unknown must be on one side of the equation by itself.\\
Rearranging Equations with Addition and Subtraction\\

The rule of equality must be maintained! Thus, if you subtract a value from the right side of the equal sign, you must subtract the same value from the left side of the equal sign. The is true for adding, dividing, and multiplying.\\

Example - Addition and Subtraction\\
Solve the equation $12=3+b+5$\\

The first step is to rearrange the equation so that the unknown is on one side of the equation by itself. This is accomplished by subtracting 3 and 5 from both sides of the equation.\\

$12-3-5=3+b+5-3-5$\\

On the right side of the equation $3-3=0$ and $5-5=0$\\

The resulting new equation would look like this:\\

$12-3-5=\mathrm{b}$\\

The last step is to do the math. That is, subtract 3 and 5 from 12. The result is: $4=b$\\

Rearranging Equations with Multiplication and Division\\
To solve for an unknown value in an equation using multiplication or division, move the unknown value to one side of the equation by itself.\\

As stated above, an equation has two sides. A multiplication and division equation also has a top and bottom that are separated by a division line. When the equation is just multiplication, the division line is not shown and all of the items are above the line.\\

To move an item from one side of an equation to the other in a multiplication or division equation, the item is moved from the top of one side to the bottom of the other or from the bottom of one side to the top of the other.\\

To state it another way, if the item that is being moved is on top of the equation, then it must be placed below when moved. If an item is below in the equation, then it must be placed above when it is moved.\\

Example 1 - Multiplication and Division\\
Solve this equation for $\mathrm{V}$ :\\
$$
254=\mathrm{V} \times 8.34 \times 35
$$
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-19}\\

Result:

$V=0.87$

Example 2 - Multiplication and Division

Solve for $\mathrm{X}$ in the following equation:
$$
6=\frac{x}{10}
$$
Step 1 - Rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by 10 .

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-19(1)}
$$
10 \times 6=X
$$
Step 2 - Solve the equation.
$$
60=\mathrm{X}
$$\\

Many equations are written without the use of the multiplication sign. For instance, $\mathrm{A}=\pi \mathrm{r}^{2}$ and $\mathrm{C}=\pi \mathrm{D}$.\\

$\pi \mathrm{r}^{2}$ is the same as $\pi \times \mathrm{r}^{2}$, or pi times $\mathrm{r}^{2}$.\\

Also, $\pi\left(r^{2}\right)$ is the same as $\pi \times\left(r^{2}\right)$ or pi times $r^{2}$.\\

Example 1 - Equation Problems\\

A triangle has a perimeter of 24', the length of the bottom is 8 ', and the length of the left side is 6 '. What is the length of the long side?\\

Step 1 - Draw a diagram of the triangle.\\

Step 2 - Place the known values on the diagram.\\

Step 3 - Write the equation.\\

$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}+\mathrm{c}$

Step 4 - Fill in the known values in the equation.\\

$24^{\prime}=6^{\prime}+8^{\prime}+c$

Step 4 - Subtract 6' and $8^{\prime}$ from both sides of the equation.\\

$24^{\prime}-6^{\prime}-8^{\prime}=\mathrm{c}$

Step 5 - Solve the equation.\\

$10^{\prime}=\mathrm{c}$ Example 2 - Equation Problems\\

Find the diameter of a pipe with a circumference of $187 / 8$ inches.\\

Step 1 - Draw a diagram of the pipe.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-21}\\

Step 2 - Place the known values on the diagram.\\

Circumference $=187 / 8 "$\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-21(1)}

Step 3 - Make any obvious conversions.

The circumference is given in inches and fractions of inches. This must be converted to a decimal before proceeding.

$187 / 8^{\prime \prime}=18.875 "$

Step 4 - Select an equation.

$\mathrm{C}=\pi \mathrm{D}$

Step 5 - Fill in the known values.

$18.75 "=\pi \mathrm{D}$

Step 6 - Divide both sides of the equation by pi.

$\frac{18.75^{\prime \prime}}{\pi}=\mathrm{D}$

Step 7 - Solve the equation.

$6 "=\mathrm{D}$ Example 3 - Equation Problems

Find the diameter of a settling basin with a surface area of $1257 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$.

Step 1 - Draw a diagram of the clarifier.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-22}

Step 2 - Place the known values on the diagram.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-22(1)}

Step 3 - Select an equation.

$A=\pi r^{2}$

Step 4 - Fill in the known values.

$1257 \mathrm{ft}^{2}=\pi \mathrm{r}^{2}$

Step 5 - Divide both sides of the equation by pi $(\pi)$.

This rearrangement will require two steps. The second step is to change the $\mathrm{r}^{2}$ to $\mathrm{r}$. This is accomplished by finding the square root of all of the values on both sides of the equation.

$\sqrt{\frac{1257 f t}{2}}=\mathrm{r}$

20 feet $=r$

Step 6 - Determine the diameter from the radius.

Since the radius is one half of the diameter this value must be multiplied by 2 .

$2 \times 20 \mathrm{ft}=40 \mathrm{ft}-$ the diameter of the clarifier Example 4 - Equation Problems

A chlorine contact chamber holds 2700 gallons. It is desired to have a contact time of 30 minutes in the chamber. What is the maximum flow rate that can pass through this chamber at this detention time.

Step 1 - Draw a diagram of the situation.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-23}

Step 2 - Place the unknown values on the diagram.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-23(1)}

Step 3 - Select an equation.
$$
\mathrm{DT}=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Flow }}
$$
Step 4 - Place the known values in the equation.
$$
30 \min =\frac{2,700 \text { gal }}{\text { gpm }}
$$
Step 5 - Divide both sides of the equation by 30 minutes.
$$
\mathrm{gpm}=\frac{2,700 \mathrm{gal}}{30 \mathrm{~min}}
$$
Step 6 - Solve the equation.

$\operatorname{gpm}=90 \mathrm{gpm}$

Finding Area\\

Area is an expression of the square unit measurement of the surface of an item or a parcel of land. The area on top of a sedimentation basin is called the surface area. The area of the end of a pipe is called the cross-sectional area ${ }^{12}$. Area is usually expressed in squared terms such as square inches $\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ or square feet $\left(\mathrm{ft}^{2}\right)$. Land may also be expressed in terms of sections (1 square mile) or acres $\left(43,560 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\right)$ or in the metric system as hectares $\left(10,000 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)$.\\

\subsection{Working with Percent}\index{Working with Percent}
Percent means parts of 100 parts. The symbol for percent is $\%$. We use percent to describe portions of the whole. For instance, if a tank is $1 / 2$ full, we say that it contains $50 \%$ of the original solution. We also use percent to describe the portion of a budget spent or a project completed. For example, "There is only $25 \%$ of the budgeted amount remaining." "The water line project is $80 \%$ complete."\\

Percentage is expressed as a whole number with a \% sign after it, except when it is used in a calculation. In a calculation, percent is expressed as a decimal. The decimal is obtained by dividing the percent by 100 . For instance, $11 \%$ is expressed as the decimal $0.11$, since $11 \%$ is equal to $11 / 100$. This decimal is obtained by dividing 11 by 100.\\

To determine what percentage a part is of the whole, divide the part by the whole.\\

Example 1 - Percent
There are 80 water meters to read, Jim has finished 24 of them. What percentage of the meters have been read?\\

$24 \div 80=0.30$

The $0.30$ is converted to percent by multiplying the answer by 100 .

$0.30 \times 100=30 \%$

Thus $30 \%$ of the 80 meters have been read.

Finding the Whole\\
To determine the whole when the part and its percentage is given, divide the part by the percentage.\\

The part\\

7 lbs.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-31}\\

The whole $10.8 \mathrm{lbs}$.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-31(1)}\\

Example 2 - Percent\\
How much $65 \%$ calcium hypochlorite is required to obtain 7 pounds of pure chlorine? The part is the 7 pounds, which is $65 \%$ of the whole.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 .
\end{enumerate}
$65 \% \div 100=0.65$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Divide the part by the decimal equivalent of the percentage.
\end{enumerate}
$7 \mathrm{lbs} \div 0.65=10.769-$ rounding $10.8 \mathrm{lbs}$.

Changing Decimals to Percent\\
To change the percent obtained above to the decimal equivalent, divide the percent by $100 .$\\

Example - Changing Decimals to Percent\\

Change $30 \%$ to a decimal.\\

$30 \% \div 100=0.30(0.30$ is the decimal equivalent of $30 \%$.\\

Percentage of a Number\\
To find the percentage of a number, multiply the number by the decimal equivalent of the percentage given in the problem.\\

Example - Percentage\\

What is $28 \%$ of $286 ?$\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change the $28 \%$ to a decimal equivalent.
\end{enumerate}
$28 \% \div 100=0.28$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Multiply $286 \times 0.28=80$
\end{enumerate}
$28 \%$ of 286 is $80.80$ is $28 \%$ of 286 .

Increase a Value by a Percent\\

To increase a value by a percent, add the decimal equivalent of the percent to " 1 ," and multiply it times the number. Example - Increasing a Value by a Percent\\

A filter bed will expand $25 \%$ during backwash. If the filter bed is 36 inches deep, how deep will it be during backwash?\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change the percent to a decimal.
\end{enumerate}
$$
25 \% \div 100=0.25
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Add the whole number 1 to this value.
\end{enumerate}
$$
1+0.25=1.25
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item Multiply times the value.
\end{enumerate}
$$
36 \text { in } \times 1.25=45 \text { inches }
$$

\section{Percentage Concentrations}
The concentration of chemicals, such as fluoride and hypochlorites, is commonly expressed as a percentage.

\section{Example - Percentage Concentrations}
A chlorine solution was made to have a $4 \%$ concentration. It is often desirable to determine this concentration in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. This is relatively simple: the $4 \%$ is four percent of a million.

To find the concentration in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ when it is expressed in percent, do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change the percent to a decimal.
\end{enumerate}
$$
4 \% \div 100=0.04
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Multiply times a million.
\end{enumerate}
$$
0.04 \times 1,000,000=40,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}
$$
We get the million because a liter of water weighs $1,000,000 \mathrm{mg} .1 \mathrm{mg}$ in 1 liter is 1 part in a million parts ( $\mathrm{ppm}) .1 \%=10,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$.

\section{Practice Problems - Percentage}
A. $25 \%$ of the chlorine in a 30 -gallon vat has been used. How many gallons are remaining in the vat?

B. The annual public works budget is $\$ 147,450$. If $75 \%$ of the budget should be spent by the end of September, how many dollars are to be spent? How many dollars will be remaining?

C. A 75 pound container of calcium hypochlorite has a purity of $67 \%$. What is the total weight of the calcium hypochlorite? D. $3 / 4$ is the same as what percentage?

E. A $2 \%$ chlorine solution is what concentration in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ?

F. A water plant produces 84,000 gallons per day. 7,560 gallons are used to backwash the filter. What percentage of water is used to backwash?

G. The average day winter demand ${ }^{16}$ of a community is 14,500 gallons. If the summer demand is estimated to be $72 \%$ greater than the winter, what is the estimated summer demand? ${ }^{16}$ Demand - When related to use, the amount of water used in a period of time. The term is in reference to the "demand" put onto the system to meet the need of customers.

\section{Pump Efficiency}
Horsepower

There are three types of horsepower associated with a pumping installation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Electrical Horsepower (EHp) - The horsepower that is purchased from the power company.

  \item Brake Horsepower (BHp) - The horsepower that is the output of the electric motor. This is the input horsepower to the pump.

  \item Water Horsepower (WHp) - The horsepower that is the output of the pump.

\end{itemize}
\section{Process - Pump or Motor}
To determine the efficiency of a pump or motor, divide the output horsepower by the input horsepower. Then multiply the result by 100 to change the decimal into percent.

$\frac{\text { Output Horsepower }}{\text { Input Horsepower }} \times 100=\%$ efficiency

Process - When \% is Given

If the efficiency of each unit is known and you wish to determine the efficiency of the entire pump station, then merely multiply the decimal equivalency of the two percentages together.

Efficiency of Motor $x$ Efficiency of Pump $=$ Station $\%$ Example 1 - Pump Efficiency

It has been determined that the water horsepower of a pump is $5 \mathrm{Hp}$ and the brake horsepower output of the motor is $7.2 \mathrm{Hp}$. What is the efficiency of the motor?

$\frac{5 \mathrm{WHp}}{7.2 \mathrm{BHp}} \times 100=69.4 \%$

Example 2 - Pump Efficiency

If a motor is $90 \%$ efficient and the output is $7.5 \mathrm{BHp}$, what is the electrical horsepower requirement?

$\frac{7.5 \mathrm{BHp}}{0.90}=8.3 \mathrm{EHp}$

Example 3 - Well Efficiency

If a pump is $70 \%$ efficient and the motor is $90 \%$ efficient, what is the efficiency of the well?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change the efficiency into decimals by dividing each by 100 .
\end{enumerate}
$\frac{70 \%}{100}=0.70, \frac{90 \%}{100}=0.90$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Multiply the two values.
\end{enumerate}
$0.70 \times 0.90=0.63$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item Multiply the value by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage.
\end{enumerate}
$0.63 \times 100=63 \%$

\section{Making Conversions}
Use

Conversions are a process of changing the units of a number in order to make the number usable in a specific instance. Common conversions in water works include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item gpm to cfs

  \item Million gallons to acre feet

  \item Cubic feet to acre feet

  \item Cubic feet of water to weight

  \item Cubic feet of water to gallons

  \item Gallons of water to weight

  \item gpm to MGD ${ }^{17}$

  \item psi to feet of head ${ }^{18}$

\end{itemize}
\section{Working with Formulas}
To use a formula, you must change the units of the data given to meet the requirements of the formula.

\section{Example - Formulas}
The formula for finding velocity ${ }^{19}$ in a pipe is $\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{Q} \div \mathrm{A}$, where $\mathrm{Q}$ is the flow in cubic feet per second. We most often measure flow in gallons per minute. To use this formula, we must often convert the flow from gpm to cfs.

\section{What Is a Conversion?}
A conversion is a number that is used to multiply or divide into another number in order to change the units of the number.

\section{Known Conversions}
In most instances, the conversion factor cannot be derived. It must be known. Therefore, tables such as the one below are used to find the common conversions.

\section{Committing to Memory}
Most operators memorize some standard conversions. This happens as a result of using the conversions, not as a result of attempting to memorize them. ${ }^{17}$ MGD (Million gallons per day) - A unit of flow and a unit of volume. ${ }^{18} \mathrm{Head}$ - The measure of the pressure of water expressed as height of water in feet: 1 psi $=2.31$ feet of head. ${ }^{19}$ Velocity - The speed at which water moves, expressed in feet per second.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Some Common Conversions & Weight \\
\hline
Linear Measurements & $1 \mathrm{ft}^{3}$ of water $=62.4 \mathrm{lbs}$ \\
\hline
1 inch $=2.54 \mathrm{~cm}$ & $1 \mathrm{gal}=8.34 \mathrm{lbs}$ \\
$1 \mathrm{foot}=30.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ & $1 \mathrm{lb}=453.6 \mathrm{grams}$ \\
$1 \mathrm{~meter}=100 \mathrm{~cm}=3.281 \mathrm{feet}=39.4$ inches 1 & $1 \mathrm{~kg}=1000 \mathrm{~g}=2.2 \mathrm{lbs}$ \\

$1 \mathrm{cfs}=448 \mathrm{gpm}$ &  \\
$1 \mathrm{gpm}=1440 \mathrm{gpd}$ &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Selecting a Conversion}
The key to selecting which conversion to use is to look at the units. If you wish to convert cubic feet of water to pounds, then you need a conversion that has both of these units $\left(1 \mathrm{ft}^{3}\right.$ of water $\left.=62.4 \mathrm{lbs}\right)$.

\section{Complex Process}
The process of converting units can be highly complex and require several steps. A working understanding of the processes used requires a basic understanding of algebra. Because this is outside of the scope of this material, a process that does not require the understanding of algebra is described below. This process works only if there is an existing conversion and only a single conversion is required.

\section{Straight Line Conversion}
The technique described below is for working with straight line conversions. A straight line conversion is one that is direct: gpm to $\mathrm{cfs}$, gal to liters, gallons to pounds, etc.

\section{Process}
The best way to describe this process is with an example. Example - Straight Line Conversion

Convert $865 \mathrm{gpm}$ to cfs.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Place the known value on the paper with the units as a fraction and with 1 as the denominator to that fraction.

  \item Place a multiplication sign $(\mathrm{x})$ after the units.

  \item Place a straight line after the $x$.

  \item Follow the straight line with an equal sign $(=)$.

\end{enumerate}
$$
865 \frac{\mathrm{gpm}}{1} \mathrm{x}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{5}
  \item Ask the following question, "What units do I want to get rid of?"
\end{enumerate}
$$
865 \frac{\mathrm{gpm}}{1} \times \frac{?}{\mathrm{gpm}}=
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{6}
  \item Place this unit under the straight line. In this case, we want to get rid of the gpm.

  \item Ask yourself, "What units do we want when we get done?"

  \item Place this unit above the straight line. The original question ask that we convert gpm to cfs. So cfs is what we want when we get done.

  \item Find a conversion that goes between these two units. From the conversion table, we find the following conversion:

\end{enumerate}
$1 \mathrm{cfs}=448 \mathrm{gpm}$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{10}
  \item Place the conversion next to the proper units above or below the line. In our example, the conversion was 448 gpm, so the 448 goes below the line next to its proper units.
\end{enumerate}
$$
865 \frac{\mathrm{gpm}}{1} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{cfs}}{448 \mathrm{gpm}}=
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{11}
  \item Solve the problem. The information above could be rewritten into a fraction.
\end{enumerate}
$$
\mathrm{cfs}=\frac{865 \mathrm{gpm} \times 1 \mathrm{cfs}}{1 \times 448 \mathrm{gpm}}=\frac{865 \mathrm{gpm} \times 1 \mathrm{cfs}}{448 \mathrm{gpm}}=1.92 \mathrm{cfs}
$$

\section{Practice Problems - Conversion}

\section{Temperature Conversion}
\section{Two Scales}
There are two scales used to report temperature: the English scale of Fahrenheit and the metric scale of Celsius. There are two classic equations used to convert between these two scales:

${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=5 / 9\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}-32^{\circ}\right)$

${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}=\left(9 / 5 \mathrm{X}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+32^{\circ}$

\section{Confusion}
Typically, these two formulas provide more confusion than clarity. The following is our attempt to share a method that we find helpful in making these conversions.

\section{The Scales}
To understand how to make these conversions, start with comparing the two scales. With the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at $32^{\circ}$ and boils at $212^{\circ}$. On the Celsius scale, water freezes at $0^{\circ}$ and boils at $100^{\circ}$.

\section{Difference of $32^{\circ}$}
We can see that if we want to go from Fahrenheit to Celsius we must start by subtracting $32^{\circ}$. To go from Celsius to Fahrenheit, we must add $32^{\circ}$.

\section{Size of the Division}
The difference between $32^{\circ}$ and $212^{\circ}$ is $180^{\circ}$. This is the difference between water freezing and boiling on the Fahrenheit scale. The difference between freezing and boiling on the Celsius scale is $100^{\circ}$. Therefore, we can see that each $1^{\circ}$ change in the Celsius scale is the same as a $1.8^{\circ}$ change in the Fahrenheit scale.

\section{Changing Scales}
As a result, to change from Celsius to Fahrenheit, we must multiply the result by $1.8$. To change from Fahrenheit to Celsius we must divide by $1.8$.

\section{Final Confusion}
The most confusing part is to determine if you should adjust for the $32^{\circ}$ first or adjust for the size of the scale first. Here are the rules:

Rule 1 - To change ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ - subtract $32^{\circ}$ then divide by $1.8$.

Rule 2 - To change ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ - multiply by $1.8$ and add $32^{\circ}$.

\section{Conclusion}
We now have two new formulas:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=\frac{{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}-32^{\circ}}{1.8} \\
&{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}={ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} X 1.8+32^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$
A Third Choice

Several textbooks show a third method of making this conversion. This is a three-step method:

Step $1-\operatorname{Add} 40^{\circ}$ to the existing value.

Step 2 - Multiply by $1.8$ if going to ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and divide by $1.8$ if going to ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Step 3 - Subtract $40^{\circ}$.

D. Change $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$\\

\section{Calculating Pressure and Head}
\section{Definition}
Pressure is the weight per unit area. Typical pressure units are pounds per square inch

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-41(1)}\\
container is not related to the volume of the container or the size of the bottom. The pressure depends on the height of the fluid in the container. (For more information, see the Hydraulics section of Chapter 2.)

\section{Pressure and Head}
The height of the fluid in a container is referred to as head. Head is a direct measurement in feet and is directly related to pressure.

\section{Relationship Between Feet and Head}
Weight of Water

Water weighs $62.4$ pounds per cubic foot.

The surface of any one side of the cube contains 144 square inches $\left(12\right.$ " x $12^{\prime \prime}=144$ in $^{2}$ ). Therefore, the cube contains 144 columns of water one foot tall and one inch square.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-42}

The weight of each of these pieces can be determined by dividing the weight of the water in the cube by the number of square inches.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-42(1)}

or $0.433 \mathrm{psi}$

Since this is the weight of one column of water one foot tall, the true expression would be $0.433$ pounds per square inch per foot of head or $0.433 \mathrm{psi} / \mathrm{ft}$.

What formula do you want here?

Conversion

We now have a conversion between feet of head and psi.

1 foot of head $=0.433 \mathrm{psi}$

While it can be calculated from the relationship above, it is also desirable to know the relationship between pressure and feet of head. In other words, 1 psi represents how many feet of head. This is determined by dividing 1 by $0.433 \mathrm{psi}$.

foot of head $=\frac{1 \mathrm{ft}}{0.433 \mathrm{psi}}=2.31 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{psi}$

In other words, if a pressure gauge were reading 10 psi, we know that the height of the water necessary to represent this pressure would be $10 \mathrm{psi} \times 2.31 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{psi}=23.1 \mathrm{ft}$. Both Conversions

$1 \mathrm{ft}=0.433 \mathrm{psi}$

$1 \mathrm{psi}=2.31$ feet

Which Conversion to Use

Many operators find having two conversions for the same thing is confusing. They agree that it is best to memorize one and stay with it. The most accurate conversion is the $1 \mathrm{ft}=0.433 \mathrm{psi}$. This is the conversion used in this text.

\section{Example - Conversion}
To convert $40 \mathrm{psi}$ to feet of head, use the standard conversion technique described earlier.
$$
40 \frac{\mathrm{psi}}{1} \times \frac{\mathrm{ft}}{0.433 \mathrm{psi}}=92.4 \text { feet }
$$
Convert 40 feet to psi.
$$
40 \frac{\mathrm{ft}}{1} \mathrm{x} \frac{0.433 \mathrm{psi}}{1 \mathrm{ft}}=17.3 \mathrm{psi}
$$

\section{Another Way}
As you can see, if you are attempting to convert psi to feet, you divide by $0.433$, and if you are attempting to convert feet to psi, you multiply by $0.433$. It can become confusing about when to divide and when to multiply. The above process can be most helpful in making that determination. However, there is another way. Notice that the relationship between psi and feet is almost two to one. It takes slightly more than two feet to make one psi. Therefore, when looking at a problem where the data is in pressure and you want it in feet, we can see that the answer will be at least twice as large as the number we are starting with. For example, if the pressure were $20 \mathrm{psi}$, we know that the head is over 40 feet. Therefore, we must divide by $0.433$ to obtain the correct answer.

\section{Practice Problems - Pressure and Head}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Make the following conversions:\\
A. Convert a pressure of 45 psi to feet of head.
\end{enumerate}
B. Convert $12 \mathrm{psi}$ to feet of head.

C. Convert 85 psi to feet of head.

D. It is 112 feet in elevation between the top of the reservoir and the watering point. What will the static pressure be at the watering point?

E. A reservoir is 20 feet deep. What will the pressure be at the bottom of the reservoir?

\section{Determining Flow}
Units

Flow is expressed in the English system of measurements using many terms. The most common flow terms include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item gpm-Gallons per minute

  \item cfs - Cubic feet per second

  \item gpd-Gallons per day

  \item MGD - Million gallons per day

\end{itemize}
\section{Conversions}
Flow rates can be converted to different units using the conversion process describe above. The most common flow conversions are $1 \mathrm{cfs}=448 \mathrm{gpm}$ and $1 \mathrm{gpm}=1440$ gpd.

Gallons per Day (gpd) to MGD

To convert gallons per day to MGD, divide the gpd by $1,000,000$.

Example - Conversion of gdp to MGD

Convert 125,000 gallons to MGD.

$\frac{125,000 \mathrm{gpd}}{1,000,000}=0.125 \mathrm{MGD}$

Convert 2,300,000 gpd to MGD.

$\frac{2,300,000 \mathrm{gpd}}{1,000,000}=0.2 .3 \mathrm{MGD}$

Conversion of MGD to gpm

There are many instances where the design or plant information is given in MGD, and we wish to have the flow in gpm. This conversion is accomplished in two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Convert to gpd by multiplying by $1,000,000$.

  \item Convert to gpm by dividing by the number of minutes in a day $(1440 \mathrm{~min} /$ day). Example - Conversion of MGD to gpm

\end{enumerate}
Convert $0.125$ MGD to gpm.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Convert the flow in MGD to gpd.
\end{enumerate}
$0.125$ MGD x 1,000,000 = 125,000 gpd

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Convert to gpm by dividing by the number of minutes in a day (24 hrs per day $x 60 \mathrm{~min}$ per hour) $1440 \mathrm{~min} /$ day.
\end{enumerate}
$$
\frac{125,000 \mathrm{gpd}}{1,440 \mathrm{~min} / \text { day }}=86.6 \text { or } 87 \mathrm{gpm}
$$
Convert gpd to gpm

The process of converting gpd to gpm is shown in the example above. The process is to divide the flow in gpd by the number of minutes in a day (1440 min/day).

\section{Conversion of gpm to $\mathrm{cfs}$}
The conversion from gpm to cfs is shown in the examples in the above section on conversions. The conversion is $1 \mathrm{cfs}=448 \mathrm{gpm}$.

\section{Determining Flow Equation}
Flow in a pipeline, channel, or stream is found using the equation:

$\mathrm{Q}=\mathrm{V} \times \mathrm{A}$

Where

$Q=$ cubic feet per second (cfs)

$V=$ velocity in feet per second $(\mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec})$

$A=$ area in square feet $\left(\mathrm{ft}^{2}\right)$

\section{Example - Determining Flow}
Find the flow in cfs in a 6 -inch line, if the velocity is 2 feet per second.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the cross-sectional area of the line in square feet. Start by converting the diameter of the pipe to inches.
\end{enumerate}
The diameter is 6 inches: therefore, the radius is 3 inches. 3 inches is $3 / 12$ of a foot or $0.25$ feet.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Now find the area in square feet.
\end{enumerate}
$$
\begin{aligned}
&A=\pi \times r^{2} \\
&A=\pi \times\left(0.25 \mathrm{ft}^{2}\right. \\
&A=\pi \times 0.0625 \mathrm{ft}^{2} \\
&A=0.196 \mathrm{ft}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
Or
$$
\begin{aligned}
&A=0.785 \times D^{2} \\
&A=0.785 \times 0.5^{2} \\
&A=0.785 \times .05 \times .05 \\
&A=0.196 \mathrm{ft}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item Now find the flow.
\end{enumerate}
$\mathrm{Q}=\mathrm{V} \times \mathrm{A}$

$\mathrm{Q}=2 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec} \times 0.196 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$

$\mathrm{Q}=0.3927 \mathrm{cfs}$ or $0.4 \mathrm{cfs}$

\section{Practice Problems - Flow}
A. Find the flow in MGD when the flow is $34,000 \mathrm{gpd}$.

B. Find the flow in gpm when the total flow for the day is 65,000 gpd.

C. Find the flow in gpm when the flow is $1.3 \mathrm{cfs}$.

D. Find the flow in gpm when the flow is $0.25 \mathrm{cfs}$.

E. Find the flow in a 4-inch pipe when the velocity is $1.5$ feet per second.

\section{Calculating Detention Time}
Detention time is the amount of time that a fluid stays in a container.

Units

Detention time is expressed in units of time. The most common are seconds, minutes, hours, and days.

\section{Calculations}
The simplest way to calculate the detention time is to divide the volume of the container by the flow rate into the container. The theoretical detention time of a container is the same as the amount of time it would take to fill the container if it were empty.

\section{Volume Units}
The most common volume units used are gallons. However, on occasion cubic feet may also be used.

\section{Time Units}
The time units will be in whatever units are used to express the flow. For instance, if the flow is in gpm, then the detention time will be in minutes. If the flow is in gpd, then the detention time will be in days. If in the final result the detention time is in the wrong time units, then simply convert to the appropriate units.

\section{Example - Detention Time}
The reservoir for the village is 85,000 gallons. The well will produce $55 \mathrm{gpm}$. What is the detention time in the tank in hours?
$$
\mathrm{DT}=\frac{85,000 \mathrm{gal}}{55 \mathrm{gpm}}=1,545 \mathrm{~min} \text { or } \frac{1,545 \mathrm{~min}}{60 \mathrm{~min} / \mathrm{hr}}=25.8 \mathrm{hrs}
$$

\section{Practice Problems - Detention Time}
A. How long will it take to fill a 50-gallon hypochlorite tank if the flow is 5 gpm?

B. Find the detention time in a 45,000 gallon reservoir if the flow rate is $85 \mathrm{gpm}$.

C. If the fuel consumption to the boiler is 35 gallons per day, how many days will the 500 gallon tank last?

D. The sedimentation basin of a water plant contains 5,775 gallons. What is the detention time if the flow is $175 \mathrm{gpm}$ ?

\section{Ratio and Proportion}
What is a Ratio?

A ratio is a relationship between two numbers. A ratio can be written using a colon $(1: 2,5: 9,20: 60)$ or a fraction $(1 / 2,5 / 9$, or $20 / 60)$.

What Is a Proportion?

A proportion exists when the relationship between one ratio is the same as the relationship between a second ratio.

How Is This Determined?

To determine if two ratios are proportional, the two are cross-multiplied. If the answers are equal, then they are proportional.

Example 1 - Ratio and Proportion

Determine if $3 / 9$ is proportional to $6 / 18$.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-47}

$9 \times 6=54$ and $3 \times 18=54$; therefore, the two ratios are proportional.

Example 2 - Ratio and Proportion

Determine if $5 / 9$ and $6 / 20$ are proportional.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-47(1)}

$9 \times 6=54$ and $5 \times 20=100$; therefore, the two are not proportional.

\section{So Now What?}
This process is an introduction into the practical use of ratios and proportions used to solve common problems. To use this process, we need to discuss one more major step and then provide some basic rules. The first step is what to do when one part of a ratio is unknown.

\section{The Unknown}
To solve for an unknown portion of a ratio, follow these steps:

Step 1 - Set up the ratios in a proportion format. Place an " $\mathrm{W}$ " in the ratio for the unknown value. Notice that we have set the two ratios up as a proportion with the colon (:) between them.
$$
\frac{2}{15}: \frac{X}{50}
$$
Step 2 - Cross-multiply keeping all numbers as numerators. (We are multiplying both sides of the equestion by the denominators over 1.)

$(15)(\mathrm{X})=(2)(50)$

Step 3 - To get the $\mathrm{X}$ on the left side of the equation, divide both sides by 15 .
$$
\mathrm{X}=\frac{(2)(50)}{15}
$$
Step 4 - Solve for X.
$$
\mathrm{X}=6.67
$$

\section{Practical Application}
Proportion problems deal with larger and smaller values of the same units. For instance, a common proportion problem might be the following:

If it takes 5 pounds of calcium hypochlorite to give the correct dosage in a 35 gallon tank, then how many pounds will it take to make 12 gallons?

Rule 1 - Set up the proportion with the same types of units on one side of the colon. Using our example above, pounds would go on one side and gallons on the other.

Rule 2 - The numerators must contain the same size of units (either larger or small units), and the denominator must contain the same size units (either larger or smaller). For instance:

$\frac{\text { Smaller Value }}{\text { Larger Value }}: \frac{\text { Smaller Value }}{\text { Larger Value }}$

or

$\frac{\text { Larger Value }}{\text { Smaller Value }}: \frac{\text { Larger Value }}{\text { Smaller Value }}$

Rule 3 - Place an " $\mathrm{X}$ " in the unknown value, and solve for " $\mathrm{X}$."

Hint

Using our example above, you can set up a verbal relationship. For instance, 5 pounds is to 35 gallons as $\mathrm{X}$ pounds is to 12 gallons. To place these in the equation, start in the upper left with the 5 pounds. The "is to" represents the equal sign. For instance:

$\frac{5 \mathrm{lbs}}{\mathrm{X}}: \frac{35 \mathrm{gal}}{12 \mathrm{gal}}$

(X) $(35 \mathrm{gal})=(5 \mathrm{lbs})(12 \mathrm{gal})$

$\mathrm{X}=\frac{(5 \mathrm{lbs})(12 \mathrm{gal})}{35 \mathrm{gal}}=1.7 \mathrm{lbs}$

Example 3 - Ratio and Proportion

If one chlorine cylinder is used in 20 days, how many will be used in 100 days?

Step 1 - Set up the proportion.

1 cylinder is to 20 days as $\mathrm{X}$ cylinders is to 100 days.

$\frac{1 \text { cylinder }}{\mathrm{X}}: \frac{20 \text { days }}{100 \text { days }}$

Step 2 - Cross-multiply.

( $\mathrm{X}$ cylinders) $(20$ days $)=(1$ cylinder $)(100$ days $)$

Step 3 - Rearrange the equation to get " $X$ " on the left by its self; divide both sides by 20 days.

$X$ cylinders $=\frac{(1 \text { cylinder })(100 \text { days })}{20 \text { days }}$

Step 4 - Solve for $\mathrm{X}$ cylinders.

\section{Pounds Formula}
Use

One of the most common formulas used by water and wastewater operators is the pounds formula. This formula is used to determine the loading on the plant and its various process units; the loading on the receiving water; and the amount of chemicals needed for a specific function, such as disinfection. The formula can also be used to determine the amount of mixed liquor in the aeration basin and the amount of sludge to be disposed of in the landfill.

\section{Basic Assumption}
The formula assumes that all of the material found in water (TSS, BOD, MLSS, Chlorine, etc.) weighs the same as water, that is, $8.34$ pounds per gallon.

\section{The Formula}
The basic pounds formula is

Lbs = Flow, MG $\times 8.34 \times$ Conc, $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Where

Lbs $=$ pounds

$M G=$ Flow or volume in millions of gallons

Conc $=$ concentration or dosage in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

\section{Process}
The process of using the pounds formula to determine pounds of a substance in water is relatively simple. Just plug the values into the appropriate slots and multiply.

However, there are two items that can cause some confusion: flows of less than one million gallons and concentrations in ppm. Flow

Flow and volume are often expressed in gallons per day, gallons per minute and millions of gallons per day. Regardless of how they are expressed, they must be converted to MG in order for them to be placed in this formula. When the flow is in gallons or million gallons per day (MGD), the pounds must be expressed in $1 \mathrm{bs} /$ day.

Flow or Volume in gpd

When a flow or volume is expressed in gallons, it must be converted to MGD by dividing it by $1,000,000$. For instance, a flow of 120,000 gpd is $0.12 \mathrm{MGD}$, and a flow of $40,000 \mathrm{gpd}$ is $0.04 \mathrm{MGD}$.

Flow or Volume in gpm

When a flow or volume is expressed in gpm, it must be first converted to gpd by multiplying by the number of minutes per day (1440) and then divided by $1,000,000$ to get MGD.

Example 1 - Flow

The flow is $250 \mathrm{gpm}$. What is the flow in MGD?

$250 \mathrm{gpm} \times 1440 \mathrm{~min} / \mathrm{day}=360,000 \mathrm{gpd}$

$360,000 \mathrm{gpd} \div 1,000,000=0.36 \mathrm{MGD}$

\section{PPM}
PPM or ppm is an abbreviation for parts per million. Parts per million is the same as $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ (milligrams per liter). While they mean the same, $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ is the preferred and more accepted unit.

\section{Example 2 -Flow}
A water treatment plant feeds alum at a dosage of $26 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. The flow is $2.5 \mathrm{MGD}$. How many pounds of alum are used each day?

$\mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{day}=\mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34, \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal} \times \mathrm{Conc}, \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

$\mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{day}=2.5 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal} \times 26 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

$\mathrm{lbs} /$ day $=542$ pounds $/$ day

\section{Practice Problems - Pounds Formula}

\section{Metric System (SI)}
\section{Description}
The system of units and measures that is commonly called the metric system is more correctly titled the SI (or System International). This is the system that is used throughout most of the world, except the United States. The metric system is a base 10 system. This base makes it very easy to convert between various units. While the system has not gained widespread acceptance in the US, it is widely accepted in most of the world, and it is highly desirable that the operator be familiar with the basic components of the system.

\section{Base Units}
The following are the base units of this system.

%\begin{tabular}{l}
%\multicolumn{2}{l|}{Quantity Unit} \\
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Length & meter & $\mathrm{m}$ \\
Mass & gram & $\mathrm{g}$ \\
Time & second & $\mathrm{s}$ \\
Temperature & Kelvin & $\mathrm{K}$ \\
Volume & liter & $\mathrm{L}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}   \\
%\end{tabular}

\section{Description of the Units}
Length

The basic unit of measurement of length is the meter. A meter is approximately 3 feet in length $(3.281 \mathrm{ft})$.

Mass

Mass in the metric system is used as a comparison with pounds in the English system. The base unit is the gram. There are approximately 454 grams in a pound.

Time

The time base of seconds in the metric system is the same as the time base in the English system.

\section{Temperature}
The basic unit of temperature in the metric system is the Kelvin unit. However, Celsius is the unit that is most commonly associated with this system. One degree Kelvin is the same size as one degree Celsius. The major difference is in the starting point (zero). In the Kelvin thermometer, $0^{\circ} \mathrm{K}$ is equal to $-273.15{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section{Metric Prefixes}
\section{English}
When a number becomes too large to handle easily, we convert it by dividing it by a value and call it something else. For instance, when we have too many feet, we divide by 3 and call the result yards, or we divide by 5,280 and call the result miles. Seldom are the divisions even numbers, and they change with each set of units. Notice that yards are feet divided by 3 , but miles are feet divided by 5,280 . This makes it difficult to remember how to make the proper conversion.

\section{Metric}
In the metric system, there are standard prefixes to numbers that have been divided in order to reduce their size. In addition, the divisions are always in multiples of 10 . The following is a listing of the basic metric prefixes:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Prefix Symbol} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Mathematical} \\
\hline
giga & $\mathrm{G}$ & $1,000,000,000$ \\
mega & $\mathrm{M}$ & $1,000,000$ \\
kilo & $\mathrm{k}$ & 1,000 \\
hecto* & $\mathrm{h}$ & 100 \\
deka* & $\mathrm{da}$ & 10 \\
Base & none & 1 \\
deci* & $\mathrm{d}$ & $0.1$ \\
centi* & $\mathrm{c}$ & $0.01$ \\
milli & $\mathrm{m}$ & $0.001$ \\
micro & $\mu$ & $0.000,001$ \\
nano & $\mathrm{n}$ & $0.000,000,0001$ \\
\hline
* Under normal circumstances these prefixes are sel- &  &  \\
dom used and should, if possible, be avoided. &  &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Metric Abbreviations}
Limitations

The following is a listing of common abbreviations used in math problems in the water and wastewater field. With a few exceptions, this listing is limited to those abbreviations that are associated with the SI or metric system units of measurement. Abbreviations associated with the English system of measurements are found at the beginning of this lesson on metric units.

\section{Metric to English Conversions}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_11_72dbedc910e6e984560cg-56}

\section{Metric Conversions}
Two Types

Like the English system, there are two types of conversions: reducing or enlarging a value within the same base and converting between bases.

\section{Conversions in the Same Base}
Prefix Is the Key

The key to making conversions within the same base lies in understanding the prefixes and their associated values. For instance, the prefix kilo indicates 1000 ; therefore, a kilogram is 1000 grams, and a kilometer is 1000 meters.

\section{Linear Conversions}
The base unit of linear measurement is the meter. The common divisions of the meter are the following:

Kilometer $=1000$ meters

Centimeter $=1 / 100$ of a meter or there are 100 centimeters in a meter.

Millimeter $=1 / 1000$ of a meter or there are 1000 millimeters in a meter.

Example 1 - Conversion

Convert 4500 meters to kilometers.

Step 1 - Divide the number of meters by 1000 (kilo).

$\frac{4,500 \text { meters }}{1,000 \text { meters } / \text { kilometers }}=4.5$ kilometers

Example 2 - Conversion

Convert $4.6$ meters to centimeters.

Step 1 - Multiply meters times 100 (centi).

$4.6$ meters $x 100 \mathrm{~cm}=460 \mathrm{~cm}$

\section{Volume Conversions}
The most common volume conversion is from liters to milliliters. Since milli is the prefix for $0.001$, liters can be converted to milliliters by multiplying times 1000 .

Likewise, milliliters can be converted to liters by dividing by 1000 .

$1 \mathrm{~L}=1000 \mathrm{~mL}$

Example 3 - Conversion

Convert 2,400 mL to liters.

Step 1 - Divide the number of milliliters by 1000 .

$\frac{2,400 \mathrm{~mL}}{1,000 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{L}}=2.4 \mathrm{~L}$

Example 4 - Conversion

Convert $0.35$ L to milliliters.

Step 1 - Multiply the number of liters times 1000 .

$0.35 \mathrm{~L} \mathrm{X} 1000 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{L}=350 \mathrm{~mL}$

\section{Mass Conversion}
The two most common mass conversions are between kilograms and grams and between milligrams and grams. Since kilo is 1000 grams, it can be converted to kilograms by dividing by 1000 . Since milli is 1000 , grams can be converted to milligrams by multiplying by 1000 .

Example 5 - Conversion

Convert 2,600 mg to grams.

Step 1 - Divide the 2,600 mg by 1,000 .

$\frac{2,600 \mathrm{~g}}{1,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{g}}=2.6 \mathrm{~g}$

Example 6 - Conversion

Convert 1,345,000 g to kilograms.

Step 1 - Divide $1,345,000 \mathrm{~g}$ by 1,000 .
$$
\frac{1,345,000 \mathrm{~g}}{1,000 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}}=1345 \mathrm{~kg}
$$

\section{Conversion to Another Base}
Key

The common conversion made between basic units is between mass and volume.

Volume in the metric system is expressed as liters, cubic meters, or cubic centimeters. The relationship between mass and volume is the following:

$1 \mathrm{~g}=1 \mathrm{ml}=1 \mathrm{cc}$, (one gram is equal to 1 milliliter is equal to 1 cubic centimeter)

Other Relationships

1 cubic meter $\left(\mathrm{m}^{3}\right)=1000$ liters

$1 \mathrm{~kg}=1 \mathrm{~L}$

\section{Cubic Measurements}
It is common practice to convert liters to cubic meters when the volume exceeds 1000 liters.

\section{Practice Problems - Answers}
Example 7 - Conversion

Convert 500 kilograms of water to liters.

Since kilograms and liters are the same base, the conversion is a simple matter of changing the units. $500 \mathrm{~kg}=500 \mathrm{~L}$

Example 8 - Conversion

Convert 3,600 L to cubic meters.

Step 1 - Divide the liters by 1000 .

$\frac{3,600 \mathrm{~L}}{1,000 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{m}^{3}}=3.6 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$

Formula $\left(\pi \mathrm{r}^{2} \mathrm{ft}\right.$. x length $\mathrm{ft}$. $\left.7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}\right)$

$1^{\text {st }}$. you have to convert the diameter from inches to feet.

\section{Volume to drainage time:}
\section{Example:}
It is time to drain your sedimentation basin for cleaning, the dimensions of the tank is 85 feet long, 40 feet wide and 15 feet deep. Using a pump that has a pumping rate of 185 gpm figure how many hours would this process take.

$1^{\text {st }}$ you have to figure how many gallons is in the tank.

Formula Gallons $=\left(\right.$ Length $\mathrm{ft}$. $\mathrm{x}$ Width $\mathrm{ft}$. $\mathrm{x}$ Depth $\left.\mathrm{ft} . \mathrm{x} 7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}{ }^{3}\right)$

Gallons $\left.=\left(85 \text { feet long x } 40 \mathrm{ft} \text {. wide x } 15 \mathrm{ft} \text {. } 7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{ft} .^{3}\right)^{2}\right)$

Gallons $=381,480$

$2^{\text {nd }}$ you need to divide the number of gallons by the pumping rate of the motor.

In this case the motor is listed as $185 \mathrm{gpm}$

Minutes $=(381,480$ gallons $\div 185 \mathrm{gpm})=2,062.05$ minutes

$3^{\text {rd }}$ you still have at least one more step to convert minutes to hours

Hours $=(2,062.05 \div 60)=34.3675$ hours rounded to $34.37$ hours

\section{NOTE THE ANSWERS MAY BE IN HOURS AND MINUTES SO YOU HAVE ANOTHER STEP}
34.37 HOURS IS NOT 34 HOURS 37 MINUTES YOU MUST MULTIPLE 60 MINUTES/HOUR BY $0.37$ HOURS TO GET MINUTES Minutes $=(60 \times 0.37)=22.2$ minutes rounded to 22 minutes Makes your answer to be 34 HOURS and 22 MINUTES

\section{Example:}
The city water usage demand is $4.3$ MGD from the water plant. The water plant is feeding $230 \mathrm{lbs}$./day of chlorine gas. What is the dose in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ?

$1^{\text {st }}$ Place the numbers where they belong on the pie as shown above.

$2^{\text {nd }}$ You need to multiply the bottom numbers on the bottom of the pie.

4.3 MGD x $8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal}=\mathbf{3 5 . 8 6}$ Mlbs now write this below your pie.

$3^{\text {rd }}$ To understand the way a pie works you need only remember that the half that needs no other information is divided by the half that is needing information to be full.

The top half needed only one piece of information to be full, which has already been given. The bottom half needed three pieces of information to be full but was only given two. So the top half is divided by the bottom half

\section{Dosage Questions using 65\% or $0.65$ Calcium Hypochlorite or HTH:}
Can also be used for any product with less than $100 \%$ available chemical

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_0c6b804a9b26a8df4e8fg-08}

\section{Example:}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_0c6b804a9b26a8df4e8fg-08(1)}

The well is pumping $0.5 \mathrm{MGD}$. You are feeding $10 \mathrm{lbs} /$ day of $\mathrm{HTH} /$ day. What is your dose $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ?

$1^{\text {st }}$ Place the numbers where they belong on the pie as shown above

$2^{\text {nd }}$ You need to realize that $10 \mathrm{lbs}$ of $\mathrm{HTH}$ is not $10 \mathrm{lbs}$ of chlorine and we are only interested in the amount of chlorine that is being fed.

$\mathrm{HTH}$ is only $65 \%$ chlorine which in decimal form is $0.65$

So if you multiply the top half of the pie you will find out how many lbs. of Chlorine is available.

$10 \mathrm{lbs}$ of HTH x $0.65=6.5 \mathrm{lbs}$ of Chlorine. Write that on the top of your pie.

$3^{\text {rd }}$ You need multiply the numbers on the bottom half of the pie.

$0.5 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal}=4.17 \mathrm{Mlbs}$. Write that on the bottom of your pie. Remember the way a pie works you need only remember that the half that needs no other information is divided by the half that is needing information to be full.

$4^{\text {th }}$ In this case the top half has all the information it needs and the bottom half is still needing the Dose $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ figured out so the top number is divided by the bottom number.

\section{$6.5 \mathrm{lbs} /$ day chlorine $\div 4.17 \mathrm{Mlbs}=\mathbf{1 . 5 6} \mathbf{~ m g} / \mathbf{L}$ dose}

\section{Example:}
The city water usage demand is $4.3 \mathrm{MGD}$ from the water plant. The water plant needs to dose with a $2.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ of chlorine gas. How many lbs./day of chlorine gas would you need to feed?

$1^{\text {st }}$ Place the numbers where they belong on the pie as shown above.

$2^{\text {nd }}$ You need to multiply the bottom numbers on the bottom of the pie.
$$
\begin{array}{r}
4.3 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal} \times 2.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}=\mathbf{8 6 . 0 7} \mathrm{lbs} / \text { day } \\
\text { now write this in the upper section of the pie. }
\end{array}
$$
Since the bottom half of the pie had all the information it needed you can see that all you had to do is multiply those numbers to figure out how many lbs/day of $100 \%$ Chlorine was needed

Now to work the same problem using the formula given to us to use by DEQ.

Chemical Feed, lbs $=($ Dose, mg/L $x$ Flow, Mlbs $)$

Formula expanded:
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Chemical Feed, } l b s=(\text { Dose }, \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal} x \text { Flow, } M G D) \\

Can also be used for any product with less than $100 \%$ available chemical

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_0c6b804a9b26a8df4e8fg-11}

Example:

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_0c6b804a9b26a8df4e8fg-11(1)}

The well is pumping 0.5 MGD. You desire a dose of $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. How many lbs of $\mathrm{HTH}$ do you need to feed per day?

$1^{\text {st }}$ Place the numbers where they belong on the pie as shown above

You need to realize that the numbers on the bottom half of the pie represent $100 \%$ Chlorine Not $\mathrm{HTH}$ or any other percent of Chlorine such as bleach etc.

$\mathrm{HTH}$ is only $65 \%$ chlorine which in decimal form is $0.65$

$2^{\text {nd }}$ You need to multiply all the bottom numbers to find out how many lbs of $100 \%$ Chlorine you would need.

$0.5 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal} \times 1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}=6.25 \mathrm{Mlbs}$ (again this is $100 \%$ chlorine)

Remember the way a pie works you need only remember that the half that needs no other information is divided by the half that is needing information to be full. In this case the bottom is full and the top needs information so the bottom number of $6.25 \mathrm{Mlbs}$ of Chlorine is divided by $0.65$.

\section{$6.25 \mathrm{Mlbs} \div 0.65=\mathbf{9 . 6 2} \mathrm{lbs} /$ day of $\mathbf{H T H}$}
Now work the same problem using the formula given to us to use by DEQ. However, you notice the formula given is only for $100 \%$ chlorine you have to add in the difference in $\%$.

\text { Chemical Feed,lbs }=(\text { Dose, } m g / L x 8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal} x \text { Flow, } \mathrm{MGD})
$$
You have to rewrite this to look like the following
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Chemical Feed, } l b s=\frac{(\text { Dose }, m g / L \times 8.34 \mathrm{lbs} / \mathrm{gal} x \text { Flow, } M G D)}{0.65 \mathrm{HTH}} \\

WEIR OVERFLOW:

\section{Circumference}
Circumference of a circle $=\pi \mathrm{x}$ diameter $\mathrm{ft}$.
$$

$$
$$
\text { Weir Overflow } g p d / f t=\frac{\text { Flow } g p d}{\text { Weir Length ft. }}
$$

\section{EXAMPLE:}
The flow into a clarifier 80 foot diameter is $185 \mathrm{gpm}$. The weir is set back 1 foot. What is the weir overflow rate gpd/ft of weir?

Convert the information you have to fill in the information you need.

$1^{\text {st }}$ You were given 185 gpm but the formula is wanting gpd.

Simply convert to gpd: $\quad 185 \mathrm{gpm} \times 1440 \mathrm{~min} / \mathrm{day}=\mathbf{2 6 6 , 4 0 0} \mathbf{g p d}$ $2^{\text {nd }}$ You need to figure out the circumference of the weir.

Diameter is $80 \mathrm{ft}$. however the weir is set in $1 \mathrm{ft}$. on each side making the actual weir diameter $78 \mathrm{ft}$.

$3^{\text {rd }}$ Now that you know the diameter of the weir figure the circumference by using the circumference formula from below.

Circumference of a circle $=\pi \mathrm{x}$ diameter $\mathrm{ft}$.
$$

\section{Backwash rate:}
A backwash formula is not available in the DEQ handout however, it is a simple formula. The main thing to remember is the smaller of the two numbers will be divided by the larger of the two numbers.

The only two numbers you need to work this is the number of gallons that were filtered and the number of gallons you used to backwash with.

\section{Example:}
You have filtered 1.5 MG before needing to backwash. You used 35,000 gallons of water to backwash the filter. What is the backwash rate $\%$ ?

$1^{\text {st }}$ You will need to convert $\mathrm{MG}$ to gpd $1.5 \mathrm{MGx} 1,000,000=1,500,000 \mathrm{gpd}$

$2^{\text {nd }}$ Divide the smaller number by the larger number

$3^{\text {rd }}$ Your answer will be in decimal form so to convert it to $(\%)$ percent multiply by 100
$$
\text { Backwash rate } \%=\frac{\text { Gallons used to Backwash }}{\text { Gallons Filtered }}
$$
Backwash rate $\%=\frac{35,000 \mathrm{gal} .}{1,500,000 \mathrm{gpd}} \times 100$

Backwash rate $\%=0.023 \times 100$

\section{FLOW ft $3 /$ min:}
$$
\text { Flow, } f t^{3} / \min =\text { Area, } f t^{2} x \text { Velocity, } f t / \min
$$
This question is asking for $\mathrm{ft}^{3} / \mathrm{min}$. We know to get $\mathrm{ft}^{3}$ we need 3 foot measurements. Two (2) of the foot measurements come from the Surface Area of the pipe $\left(A=\pi r^{2}\right)$ The $3^{\text {rd }}$ foot measurement simply comes from the velocity $(\mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{min})$.

\section{Example:}
What is the flow in $\mathrm{ft} 3 / \mathrm{min}$ for a pipe that is 18 inches in diameter and the velocity is $150 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{min} . ?$

$1^{\text {st }}$ We need to find out the surface area of the pipe and to do that we need to convert some numbers to use the $\left(A=\pi r^{2}\right)$ formula.

The pipe is 18 inches in diameter, but we need ft. to make this work.

To do this we divide 18 inches by 12 inches/ft.
$$
\text { Diameter }=\frac{18 \text { inches }}{12 \text { inches } / \mathrm{ft}}=1.5 \mathrm{ft}
$$
NOTE: A common mistake here is to forget that you are still in Diameter when you need radius for the formula.
$$
\text { radius }=\frac{1.5 \mathrm{ft} .}{2}=0.75
$$
Now that we have the radius we can calculate the Surface area $\mathrm{ft}^{2}$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text { Area } f t^{2}=3.14 \times .75 \times .75 \\
&\text { Area }=\mathbf{1 . 8 t ^ { 2 }}
\end{aligned}
$$
$2^{\text {nd }}$ If the Velocity is not in $\mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{min}$ convert until you get it there.

In this case the Velocity is already in $\mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{min}$ so we just need to fill in the formula and calculate. Velocity is $150 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{min}$.
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Flow, } f t^{3} / \mathrm{min}=\text { Area, } f t^{2} \times \text { Velocity, } f t / \mathrm{min} \\
\text { Flow, } f t^{3} / \mathrm{min}=1.8 \text { Area, } f t^{2} \times 150 \text { Velocity, } f t / \mathrm{min}
\end{gathered}

\section{HYDRAULIC SURFACE LOADINGRATE}
When figuring hydraulic surface loading rate you need to remember that the average wastewater production per person per day is 70 to 100 gallons. It is better when figuring loading rates to use the higher per person per day production. (100 gallons).

\section{Example:}
A discharging lagoon measures 125 feet wide and 450 feet long, it is serving a population of 400 people. What is the hydraulic surface loading rate in $\mathrm{gpd} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}$ ?

$\frac{(\text { Number of people } x 100 \text { gal per person per day) }}{(\text { length ft. } x \text { width } f \mathrm{f} .)}=$ Hydraulic surface loading rate in $g p d / f t^{2}$

\begin{gathered}
\frac{(400 \text { people } x 100 \text { gallons per person })}{(450 \mathrm{ft} . \operatorname{long} x 125 \mathrm{ft} . \text { wide })}=\mathrm{gpd} / \mathrm{ft}^{2} \\
\frac{40,000 \mathrm{gallons}}{56,250 \mathrm{ft}^{2}}=0.71 \mathrm{gpd} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}

\section{ORGANIC LOADING RATE CALCULATIONS}
Organic loading rate calculations tell the operator the amount of food entering the plant. These calculations are used for wastewater treatment ponds, discharging lagoons, rotating biological contactors, or trickling filters.

\section{Example:}
There is a flow of $0.04$ MGD going to a discharging lagoon that measures 125 feet wide and 450 feet long with a BOD concentration is $125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. What is the Organic loading rate $\mathrm{lbs} \mathrm{BOD} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}$ ?

Formula as written in DEQ handout
$$
\frac{B O D \text { applied,lbs }}{\text { Surface Area,ft }}=\text { Organic Loading, lbs. BOD/ft } 2
$$
Above formula explained on the following page. $\frac{(\text { Flow MGD } x \text { BOD mg/Lx 8.34lbs } / \text { gal })}{(\text { length ft. } x \text { width } f t .)}=$ Organic loading, lbs. $B O D / f^{2}$

As you use this workbook, some of you may come up with a slightly different answer than what is shown. This may be due to how you "rounded off" as you worked through the problem. Your answer is correct if you come within plus or minus $10 \%$ of what is given. If you are outside of that range, recheck your work. As you work problems within each topic, the problems become more difficult.

Answers are given in the back of the book. The first problem from each section and other selected problems are worked out completely.

\section{Fractions, Decimals, Ratios and}
\section{Exponents $\quad$ Fig. I: Fractions, numerator and denominator}
\section{Fractions}
Fractions are used when we want to express a portion of a whole object.

For example: If a pie is cut into six pieces and you eat

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_4d34b76b97ee13a67df7g-01}\\
two pieces, you have eaten $2 / 6$ or $1 / 3$ of the pie.

The top number, or numerator, represents how many parts we ate; the bottom number, or denominator, represents how many parts the whole pie has.

The bar in between divides the two numbers. This means the top number, numerator, is divided by the bottom number, denominator. The bar can also read divided by - for example, $1 / 2$ is one divided by two.

Fractions can also be used in units of measurement such as, miles per hour (miles/hour) or miles per gallon (miles/ gallon), where the word per means divided by.

\section{Decimals}
Decimal numbers, such as $3.25$, are used when one needs more precision than whole numbers provide. Decimals are based on units of ten (tenths) and multiples of tenths. The value of a digit in a decimal number depends upon the place of the digit (see Table 1).

Table 1: Values of digits in decimal numbers

\begin{tabular}{|ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{Place (underlined)} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Name of} \\
Position &  \\
$\underline{1.234567}$ & Ones (units) \\
$1 . \underline{2} 34567$ & Tenths \\
$1.2 \underline{3} 4567$ & Hundredths \\
$1.23 \underline{4567}$ & Thousandths \\
$1.234 \underline{5} 67$ & Ten thousandths \\
$1.2345 \underline{6} 7$ & Hundred thousandths \\
$1.23456 \underline{7}$ & Millionths \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Math Concepts Review}
A fraction having a 10 or multiple of 10 in the denominator can be written as a decimal. For example, the fraction $2 / 10$ could be written as the decimal number 0.2. The period or decimal point before the two indicates that this is a decimal. The decimal $0.2$ could be pronounced as two tenths or zero point two. Decimals are

Fig. 2: Two-tenths

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
$1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ & $1 / 10$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

similar to money. A dime is $1 / 10$ of a dollar. Two dimes are $2 / 10$ or $1 / 5$ of a dollar. To visualize this, see Figure $2 .$

When adding or subtracting decimal numbers, remember to place the decimal points directly over and under each other.

\section{Ratios}
Fig.3: Ratios

A ratio is a comparison of two numbers. Ratios can be written as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a fraction

  \item using the word "to"

  \item using a colon.

\end{itemize}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_4d34b76b97ee13a67df7g-02}

For example, comparing the number of circles to the number of triangles in Fig.3, we can use a fraction and say "3/4", or say "three to four," or use a colon, $3: 4$.

Ratios tell how one number is related to another number. A ratio of $1: 5$ says that the second number is five times as large as the first.

\section{Comparing Ratios}
To compare ratios, write them as fractions. If ratios are equal when they are written as fractions, they are equal.

Multiplying or dividing each term by the same nonzero number will give an equal ratio. For example, the ratio $3: 6$ is equal to the ratio $1: 2$ because you can divide both 3 and 6 by 3 and produce 1:2. and To tell if two ratios are equal, use a calculator and divide. If the division gives the same answer for both ratios, then they are equal.

\section{Proportion}
A proportion is an equation with a ratio on each side. It is a statement that two ratios are equal. An example of an equal proportion: $1 / 2=3 / 6$

\section{Percent}
A percent is a ratio whose second term is 100. Percent means "out of 100 " or "parts per hundred. We can use the percent symbol (\%) as a handy way to write a fraction whose denominator is 100 . For example, instead of saying " 27 out of every 100 professional volleyball players are female," we can say " $27 \%$ of professional volleyball players are female."

A percent can also be written as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left like this (or dividing by 100): $27 \%=0.27$ (Note: if there is no whole number, always use a zero before a decimal place.)

And a decimal can be written as a percent, by moving the decimal point two places to the right like this (or multiplying by 100 ): $0.65=65 \%$

\section{Relationship Between Ratios, Fractions, Decimals and}
\section{Percents}
At some time, you may need to interchange ratios, fractions, decimals and percents. Table 2 shows the relationship between them.

Table 2: Comparing Ratio, Fraction, Decimal \& Percent

\begin{tabular}{|c|r|c|c|}
\hline
Ratio & Fraction & Decimal & Percent \\
\hline
7 to 100 & $7 / 100$ & $0.07$ & $7 \%$ \\
\hline
29 to 100 & $29 / 100$ & $0.29$ & $29 \%$ \\
\hline
64 to 100 & $64 / 100$ & $0.64$ & $64 \%$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Exponents}
Exponents are a shorthand way to show how many times a number (called the base) is multiplied times itself. A number with an exponent is said to be "raised to the power" of that exponent; the exponent is the "power".

Example 1: $6^{2}$ means "six to the second power" or "six squared." To calculate, you would multiply 6 times itself two times: $6 \times 6=36$

Example 2: $4^{3}$ means "four to the third power" or "four cubed." To calculate, multiply 4 times itself 3 times: $4 \times 4 \times 4=64$

Exponents apply to units as well as numbers. For example:

$1 \mathrm{ft} \times 1 \mathrm{ft} \times 1 \mathrm{ft}=1 \mathrm{ft}^{3}$ or 1 cubic foot (abbreviated cu $\mathrm{ft}$ )

\section{Math Concepts Review}
\section{Converting Units}
When you are working math problems, numbers usually have units attached. Sometimes the units you are given are not the units in which you want to express your answer. So you need to convert units.

Converting units is easy when you use the goalpost method to set up your problems. Conversion factors (numbers and units) are placed within goalposts $\left(\left.\right|^{-}\right)$). You can keep adding goalposts with conversion factors until you end up with the units you are seeking. If you want a unit in the numerator (above the line) to cancel, add a conversion factor with that unit in the denominator (below the line). Since, in a conversion factor, both sides are equal, you can place it within the goalpost either way.

When you solve a problem, numbers above the line are multiplied together, then divided by numbers below the line. (If you need to add or subtract, do that before you multiply and/or divide.)

Units (feet, gallons, seconds, etc.) above and below the line will cancel each other out. If a problem is set up properly, the only units to the left of the ' $=$ ' sign that do not cancel are the units in which you want to express your final answer.

For example: Change 2 years to seconds. (Conversion factors are placed so the denominator of the following factor cancels the numerator of the existing factor.)

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|}
2 yrs & 365 days & 24 (hrs & 60 min & $60 \mathrm{sec}$ \\
\end{tabular}$=63,072,000$ seconds

You could also do the opposite: Change 93,000,000 seconds to years. (Note: we use the same factors, but place them so the denominator of the next factor cancels the numerator.)

\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|}
$93,000,000$ sec & 1 miny & 1 hr & 1 day & $1 \mathrm{yr}$ \\
\end{tabular}$=2.95 \mathrm{yrs}$

There is no limit to the number of conversion factors you can use. Use as many as you need to get from the units you have to where you want to be.

Should you need to convert your answer from one unit to another, such as from cubic feet/second to gallons/minute, you can easily do that by adding goalposts with appropriate conversion factors to convert from seconds to minutes $(60$ seconds $=$ 1 minute) and cubic feet to gallons ( 1 cubic foot $=7.48$ gallons). Place conversion factors within the goalposts in such a way that the units you want to get rid of will cancel and the units you want to convert to will remain. You can find conversion factors on the inside back cover of this manual and in the booklet Wastewater Formulas and Conversion Factors.

The first and last goalpost "upright" is omitted to eliminate extra lines. When doing problems, be sure to write down the formula you will use! Circle your answer(s).

To see how problems are set up, see the examples on the pages 13 and $17 .$

\section{Significant Figures}
Every measurement has a degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty comes from the accuracy of the measuring device and from the skill of the person doing the measuring. Because measured quantities are often used in calculations, the precision of the calculation is limited by the precision of the measurements on which it is based. For example, if you calculate area based on measurements to the nearest foot, it is ridiculous to try to give an answer to the nearest tenth or hundredth of a square foot. For this reason, we use significant figures to help us determine how to express calculated answers. A calculated number cannot be more accurate than the measurements upon which it is based.

We use the following significant figure rules to determine how many significant figures in a number:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All non-zero numbers are significant. $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)$

  \item Zeros within a number are significant. (Example: Both '3076' and '60.02' contain four significant figures.)

  \item Zeros that do nothing but set the decimal point are not significant. (So, the number ' 630,000 ' has two significant figures.)

  \item Trailing zeros that aren't needed to hold the decimal point are significant. (For example, '2.00' has three significant figures.)

  \item If you are not sure whether a digit is significant, assume that it isn't. (For example, if a problem reads: "The height is 200 inches," assume the height is known to one significant figure.)

\end{itemize}
There are also rules when adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing numbers:

\begin{itemize}
  \item When measurements are added or subtracted, the answer can contain no more decimal places than the least accurate measurement.
\end{itemize}
Example: $22.25 \mathrm{ft}+7.125 \mathrm{ft}+11 \mathrm{ft}$

When added together, you get $40.375 \mathrm{ft}$, but you should give the sum as '40' feet. (See Rounding Off below.)

\section{Math Concepts Review}
\begin{itemize}
  \item When measurements are multiplied or divided, the answer can contain no more significant figures than the least accurate measurement.
\end{itemize}
Example: $\underline{29.5}$ should be given as '4,' not ' $4.214$ '

\begin{itemize}
  \item When the answer to a calculation contains too many significant figures, it must be rounded off. (See Rounding Off below.)
\end{itemize}
\section{Losing Significant Figures}
You may sometimes 'lose' significant figures when performing calculations. For example, if you subtract $21.75-21.50$, the answer, ' $0.25$ ' has two significant figures even though the original values contained four significant figures. When that happens, don't worry about it - just give the answer in the number of significant figures it has.

\section{Rounding Off}
When rounding off, the usual method is to round down numbers with digits less than ' 5 ' and round up numbers with digits ' 5 ' or greater.

Example: $7.3$ would be rounded off (down) to ' 7 '; but $7.7$ would be rounded off (up) to ' 8 .'

You can round off the number to fewer digits following these rules for rounding off:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Determine how many digits (numbers) you want in your answer.

  \item Then, look at the next number (the number after those digits). If it is less than 5 , just drop that number and all remaining numbers.

  \item If the number is 5 or more, make the preceeding number one unit greater, then drop all remaining numbers.

\end{itemize}
Example: If we want to round off $1.5263792$ inches to two digits, we look at the third number. Since the third number, 2, is less than 5, we drop it and all remaining numbers and end up with $1.5$ inches.

If we round off $1.5263792$ inches to three digits, we look at the fourth number. Since the fourth number, 6 , is more than 5, we make the preceeding number one unit larger, then drop the remaining numbers. So our answer becomes $1.53$ inches. When working problems, always wait until you get the final answer before rounding off.

\section{Examples}

  \item How many feet in 30 inches?

$1 y^{3}$ & $3 \mathrm{ft}$ & $3 \mathrm{ft}$ & $3 \mathrm{ft}$ \\

  \item If you know 1 gallon of water weights $8.34$ pounds and that 1 cubic foot of water weighs $62.4$ pounds, how many gallons are in 1 cubic foot of water?
\end{enumerate}
Think it through: You want to know how many gallons per cubic foot, so set up the conversion factors so those are the units that are left after canceling.

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
1 gallon & $62.4$ pounds $=7.48$ gallons $/$ cubic foot \\
\hline
$8.34$ pounds & 1 cubic foot \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Math Concepts Review}
\section{Rearranging a Formula}
Sometimes the way a formula is written, the item you are trying to find does not stand alone. You must rearrange or transpose the formula to solve for the unknown quantity.

When rearranging formulas, think of a formula as a balanced scale - the quantity on the left is equal to the quantity on the right. If we add an amount to one side of the scale, to keep balance we must also add the same amount to the other side. Similarly if we take away an amount from one side, we must also take the same amount away from the other side. The same applies to formulas. If we add an amount to one side, we must also add the same amount to the other to keep the formula equal. If we subtract an amount from one side we must also

Figure 4: Formulas are like a

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_4d34b76b97ee13a67df7g-08}\\
subtract the same amount from the other side.

This also applies to multiplication and division: if we multiply one side of a formula by any amount, we must also multiply the other side by the same amount. Similarly, if we divide one side of the formula by any amount we must also divide the other side by the same amount.

When you are trying to rearrange a formula, remember you may:

\begin{itemize}
  \item add or subtract the same quantity to or from both sides

  \item multiply or divide both sides by the same quantity

\end{itemize}
Other operations are also allowed, such as squaring and taking the square root $-$ as long as whatever you do to one side of the formula, you also do to the other.

How do you decide whether to add, subtract, multiply or divide? First, look at what you are trying to find and ask yourself: 'What has been done to it?' For example, suppose you are given the formula:
$$
\text { E ormula Detention time }=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Flow rate }}
$$
and you want to find the volume. You see that, the way the formula is written, volume is divided by flow rate. To get volume to stand alone, you must "undo" the division by doing the opposite: multiplication. But remember, when working with a formula, whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other. In this case, you would multiply both sides by flow rate as shown below:

Flow rate $\mathbf{x}$ Detention time $=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Flow rate }} \times$ Flowrate

Flow rate cancels out on the right side leaving Volume standing alone. We can flip sides and write:

Volume $=$ Flow rate $x$ Detention time

Suppose you start with the same formula, but you want to solve for the flow rate.
$$
\text { E ormula } \quad \text { Detention time }=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Flow rate }}
$$
Since Flow rate is on the bottom (in the denominator), multiple both sides by Flow rate so it is on the top (in the numerator):

Flow rate $\mathrm{x}$ Detention time $=$ Volume $\mathrm{x}$ Flow rate
$$
\text { Flow rate }
$$
Flow rate still does not stand alone - it has been multiplied by Detention time. To undo multiplication, we must divide both sides by Detention time, then cancel as shown below:

Flow rate $\mathrm{x}$ Detentiontime $=$ Volume

\section{Detentiontime Detention time}
So finally, $\quad$ Flow rate $=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Detention time }}$

In another example you know Flow rate and Area, and want to find Velocity. You choose the formula:
$$
\text { E ormula Flow rate }=\text { Velocity } \times \text { Area }
$$
Since the velocity has been multiplied by the area, you "undo" that by dividing both sides of the equation by area, then canceling, as shown below:
$$
\frac{\text { Flow rate }}{\text { Area }}=\text { Velocity } \times \frac{\text { Area }}{\text { Area }}
$$
Then, flip sides to get: Velocity $=\frac{\text { Flow rate }}{\text { Area }}$

\section{Math Concepts Review}
Sometimes you may need to substitute terms in a formula. The formula below is the common formula used to find the area of a circle.
$$
\text { E ormula } \mathbf{A}=\otimes \mathbf{x} \mathbf{r}^{2} \text {, where } r \text { is the radius }
$$
Often, however, you may know the diameter rather than the radius. Given the diameter, you could divide it by 2 , since the radius is half the diameter. Or, you could replace $r$ with $d / 2$ as shown below:
$$
\begin{aligned}
A &=\nabla x \quad \frac{\mathrm{d}}{2}{ }^{2} \\
&=3.14 \times \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{4} \text { or } \frac{3.14 \times \mathrm{d}^{2}}{4} \\
A &=0.785 \times \mathrm{d}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
Another formula that is used often in collection system

Figure 5: The radius of a circle is one-half the diameter.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_4d34b76b97ee13a67df7g-10}\\
calculations is:
$$
\text { E ormula Slope }=\underline{\text { Rise }}
$$
Slope is defined as Rise/Run (the upward rise divided by the length of the run). Because the rise is less than the run, slope is a decimal number-always less than one. Often, one wants to know the percent slope. Remember, to change a decimal number to a percent, you must multiply by 100 . And, whatever you do to one side of a formula, you must do to the other. So the formula becomes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text { Slope } \times 100=\frac{\text { Rise }}{\text { Run }} \times 100 \\
&\text { Slope }(\%)=\underline{\text { Rise }} \times \mathbf{1 0 0}
\end{aligned}
$$
When using formulas to solve problems, take care to rearrange the formula correctly. If you must use several steps to do it, show those steps in your work so you can go back and see what you did. If you can't rearrange a formula correctly, you can't get a correct answer.
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text { Don't forget that to get } \\
&\text { your final answer in the } \\
&\text { correct units, you may } \\
&\text { need to use one or more } \\
&\text { conversion factors! }
\end{aligned}
$$

\section{Formula Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A 1000-foot pipe with a $2.0 \%$ slope enters a lift station at an invert elevation of $940.0$ feet. What is the elevation at the other end of the pipe?
\end{enumerate}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2022_09_16_4d34b76b97ee13a67df7g-11}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item What is the loading, in pounds/day, of wastewater with a strength of $500 \mathrm{mg} / 1$ and a flow rate of $0.89$ million gallons/day?
\end{enumerate}
$$
\text { E ormula } \text { Loading }=\text { concentration }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{l}) \times \text { flow }(\mathrm{MGD}) \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gallon}
$$
When doing this problem, it is important to note that $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{l}$ is equivalent (equal) to 1 part per million (1 part/1 million parts). In this example, to show in a non-rigourous mathematical explanation that units cancel, we will use as a conversion factor a compound fraction - which is resolved by inverting the denominator and multiplying as shown in the second step.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}\text { Loading }=500 \mathrm{mg} & 0.89 \text { million gal } & 8.34 \mathrm{lb} & 1 \mathrm{part} / \mathrm{million} \text { parts } \\\hline \mathrm{L} & \text { day } & \text { gallon } & 1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}\end{array} \\
& \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}500 \mathrm{mg} & 0.89 \text { million gat } & 8.34 \mathrm{lb} & 1 \mathrm{~L} & 1 \text { part } \\\hline \downarrow & \text { day } & 9 \mathrm{gl} & 1 \mathrm{mg} & 1 \text { million parts }\end{array} \\
& \text { Loading }=3,711.3 \mathrm{lb} / \text { day } 
\end{aligned}

\section{Math Concepts Review}
\section{Complex Fractions}
If someone asks you how many half dollars there are in one dollar, you probably wouldn't think twice before you said, "Two." Or, if they asked you how many quarters in a dollar, you could easily come up with the correct answer: "Four." When you are figuring this out, you are actually using complex fractions. If we write it mathematically, it would look like this:
$$
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} \text { and } \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}}
$$
When you solve complex fractions, you simply invert and multiply-that is, turn the denominator (bottom number) upside-down, then multiply the two numbers.

When you figured out how many half dollars in a dollar and how many quarters in a dollar, you did this in your head:
$$
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{\frac{2}{4}} \times \frac{2}{1}=2 \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{1} \times \frac{4}{1}=4
$$
Sometimes you may have a fraction on top of a fraction. Don't let that throw you. Just do the same thing: invert and multiply! For example: How many quarters (quarter dollars) are there in a half dollar? The math would look like this:
$$
\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1}=\frac{4}{2} \text { or } 2
$$
If you have numbers with units, keep the units and cancel them when appropriate:
$$
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \text { dotlár }}{\frac{1}{4} \text { dottar }}=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1}=\frac{4}{2} \text { or } 2
$$
Example: Find the detention time when the volume is 10,000 gal and the flow rate is $250 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min}$.
$$
\text { - ormula Detention Time }=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Flow Rate }}
$$
$$

\section{Solving Math Problems Checklist}
Do not be tempted to look at a problem and start punching numbers into a calculator. Using a calculator this way only ensures you will get the wrong answer quickly. Instead, follow this checklist to help ensure success!

$\square$ Read the problem carefully. (You may need to read it twice!)

$\square$ Draw and label a picture of the problem.

$\square$ Think about the information you are given and what you want to know.

$\square$ Choose a formula (some problems may require more than one formula).

$\square$ Write down the formula as it is given. Rearrange it if it is not in the form you need.

$\square$ Replace the words in the formula with the numbers and units of the information you have been given (sometimes you may be given information you don't need - don't let that fool you!).

$\square$ If needed, add conversion factors to end up with the requested units. Cancel (cross off) units to make sure the only units left are the ones you want in your answer.

$\square$ Now, get out your calculator and multiply all the numbers on the top and divide by all the numbers on the bottom.

$\square$ Ask yourself if the final answer is reasonable for the question being asked.

$\square$ Double check to make sure your answer is in the units being asked for. (Many times answers are incorrect because of failure to make sure the final answer is in the correct units!)

$\square$ Smile at your correct answer $\bigodot$
