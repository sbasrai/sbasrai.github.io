\section{Why Treat Wastewater}\index{Why Treat Wastewater}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wastewater is used water from home and industries\\
\item Wastewater must be treated prior to returning it back into the environment - typically into the receiving waters which include lakes, rivers and ocean.


\item Wastewater treatment removes:
\begin{itemize}
\item organic matter
\item inorganic  pollutants including plant nutrients - nitrogen and phosphorous\\
\item pathogenic (disease causing) organisms\\
\end{itemize}

\item Wastewater treatment protects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The environment
\item Human health
\end{itemize}

\item In the receiving waters, inadequately treated wastewater discharge depletes dissolved oxygen levels - \hl{Eutrophication}, potentially destructing its normal aquatic life including fish.  Wastewater discharge promotes eutrophication due to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous present in wastewater effluent promotes growth of plant and algal matter.  Dissolved oxygen is consumed as a part of the normal decay of this plant and algal matter.  
\item The consumption of organic material present in wastewater discharge by aerobic bacteria also results in oxygen depletion in the receiving waters.  


\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Wastewater Treatment Regulations}\index{Wastewater Treatment Regulations}
% \begin{snugshade*}
% \item \noindent\textsc{Wastewater Treatment Regulations}
% \end{snugshade*}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \hl{National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program} was created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act (CWA)
\item Applies to sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the United States.
\item Requires all facilities discharging “pollutants” into any body of water in the USA to obtain and comply with a \hl{NPDES permit}
\item NPDES permit \hl{establishes} \textul{discharge limits}, \textul{monitoring} and \textul{reporting} \hl{requirements}\\
\item The NPDES permitting and enforcement responsibilities have been delegated by the EPA to the State of California for implementation through the \hl{State Water Resources Control Board(SWRCB)} and the \textul{nine} \hl{Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards)}.
\item In California, NPDES permits are also referred to as waste discharge requirements (WDRs) that regulate discharges to waters of the United States.
\end{itemize}


\section{Wastewater Process Overview}\index{Wastewater Process Overview}
Wastewater treatment involves the following elements:

\subsection{Generation}\index{Generation}

Wastewater originates from domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities. The characteristics of wastewater vary depending on the source. Types of wastewater include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Domestic Sewage:}  wastewater derived principally from dwellings, business buildings, institutions, and \\
\item \hl{Industrial Sewage:}  liquid waste from industrial processes\\
\end{itemize}
Typical per person generation of wastewater in the USA is about 70-100 gallons per day

\subsection{Collections}\index{Collections}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wastewater is collected from its point of origin - home, businesses, industries etc. and conveyed via sewer lines to a centralized wastewater treatment facility.  
\item When the rainwater drainage is made part of the sewer system, the system is termed as \hl{Combined System}.  
\item The system where the sewage is conveyed separately from the stormwater flows is termed as \hl{Separated System}.  
\item In the Separated System, the Sanitary Sewers convey the wastewater and the Stormwater Sewer conveys the storm water flows.  
\item For the Combined System, rainstorms pose the threat of overwhelming the sewers and the treatment plant
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
			\hspace{2.6cm} Separated System \hspace{3.2cm} \parbox{\textwidth}{Combined System}\\

\subsection{Treatment}\index{Treatment}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wastewater treatment can involve physical, chemical or biological processes or combinations of these processes depending on the required outflow standards. 
\item Wastewater treatment typically involves a series of steps with increasing level of treatment:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Preliminary}:  The preliminary process removes large/coarse solids which include rocks, tree branches, grit and other debris present in wastewater.
\item \hl{Primary}:  The primary process is also a physical process where the separable wastewater solids - solids that float and solids that can settle, are removed.  
\item \hl{Secondary}:  Secondary treatment is a biological treatment process where microorganisms consume the organic matter present in the wastewater. 
\item \hl{Tertiary or Advanced Treatment}:  The tertiary/advanced treatment processes improve the quality of treated water beyond the secondary treatment level.  This process may include nutrient removal and disinfection.
\end{itemize}

A generalized layout/process sequencing in a wastewater treatment plant is shown below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{TreatmentFlow}
\end{center}
Individual wastewater treatment processes involve different process options or sequences which are illustrated in the graphic below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{Treatment}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}
As the treatment process becomes more advanced along with the increasing awareness of the resources involved in the treatment, there is a move underway to transform Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTF) to Renewable Resource Recovery Facilities (RRRF) or Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRF) - one which produces clean water, recovers energy and generates nutrients.

\subsection{Disposal or Reuse}\index{Disposal or Reuse}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wastewater treatment processes can be designed to \hl{dispose} the treated water where the water is reintroduced to the environment or for \hl{reuse} where the treated water is \hl{reclaimed} or \hl{recycled} - for various purposes including irrigation, industrial use or for potable use.
\item Water disposal methods include:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Surface water discharge}
\item \hl{Subsurface discharge}
\end{itemize}
\item Water reuse methods include:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Potable water reuse
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Indirect potable reuse:}  Here the treated water is blended with groundwater or surface water and then reclaimed and treated further 
for drinking (potable) water use
\item \hl{Direct potable reuse:}  Here the treated wastewater is subjected to advanced treatment and introduced directly into a municipal water supply system
\end{itemize}
\item Water reclamation for irrigation or industrial use\\
\item Land application for beneficial use\\
\end{itemize}
\item Solids generated from the wastewater treatment process may be removed and disposed to a landfill or subject to further treatment which may allow for energy recovery - from the organic solids and for beneficial reuse due to its plant nutrient content.\\
\end{itemize}

For converting one measurement unit to another.

Step 1:  Make sure the original unit is for the same measurement as the conversion unit.  So if the original unit is for area, say ft$^2$ the conversion unit can be another area unit such as in$^2$ or acre but it cannot be gallons as gallon is a unit of volume.

Step 2: Write down the conversion formula as:

$Quantity \enspace in \enspace converted \enspace unit = Quantity \enspace (\cancel{Original \enspace Unit}) *   Conversion  \enspace Factor \enspace  \frac{Conversion \enspace unit}{\cancel{Original \enspace unit}}$


\section{Example Problems}
Problem 1\\
Convert 1000 $ft^3$ to cu. yards\\

$1000 \cancel{ft^3}*\frac{cu.yards}{27\cancel{ft^3}} = 37 cu.yards$

Problem 2\\
Convert 10 gallons/min to $ft^3$/hr\\

$\frac{10 \cancel{gallons}}{\cancel{min}}*  \frac{ft^3}{7.48 \cancel{gallons}}  * \frac{60 \cancel{min}}{hr}   = \frac{80.2ft^3}{hr}$


Problem 3\\
Convert 100,000 $ft^3$ to acre-ft.\\
$100,000 \cancel{ft^3} * \frac{acre-ft}{43,560 \cancel{ft^2-ft}} =  2.3 acre-ft$\\
\textbf{Note:} From the conversion table: acre = 43,560 $ft^2$\\
Thus, acre-ft  = 43,560 $ft^2$-ft\\

\section{Pounds Formula}\index{Pounds Formula}
%\section{Pounds Formula}\index{Pounds Formula}

% \begin{snugshade*}
% \item \noindent\textsc{Pounds Formula}
% \end{snugshade*}
Pounds formula is used for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculating the quantity in pounds of a particular wastewater constituent entering or leaving a wastewater treatment process
\item Calculating the pounds of chemicals to be added\\
\end{itemize}
So if the concentration of a particular constituent (in mg/liter) and the volume or flow of wastewater is given, one can calculate the amount of that constituent in pounds using the following – Pounds Formula:
$$lbs \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace \frac{lbs}{day}=concentration(\frac{mg}{l})*8.34*volume(MG) \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace flow(\frac{MG}{day}(MGD)$$

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{PoundsFormula}
\end{center}

There are three variables – (lbs, concentration and volume) and one constant (8.34) in the pounds formula.  Knowing any of the two variables in the formula, one can calculate the third (unknown) variable by rearranging the equation.

\section{Concentration}\index{Concentration}

Concentration is typically expressed as mg/l which is the weight of the constituent (mg) in 1 l (liter) of solution (wastewater).  As 1 l of water weighs 1 million mg, a concentration of 1 mg/l implies 1 mg of constituent per 1 million mg of water or one part per million (ppm).   \textbf{Thus, mg/l and ppm are synonymous.}\\  
Sometimes the constituent concentration is expressed in terms of percentage.\\
\vspace{6pt}
For example:  sludge containing 5\% solids or a 12.5\% chlorine concentration solution.\\
\vspace{6pt}
As one liter of water weighs 1,000,000 mg, one percent of that weight is 10,000 mg.  So 1\% solids implies 10,000 mg of solids per liter or 10,000 mg/l or 10,000 ppm.\\
\vspace{6pt}
$1\% concentration = 10,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace\frac{mg}{l}$\\
$0.1\% concentration = 1,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \frac{mg}{l}$\\
$0.01\% concentration = 100 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \frac{mg}{l}$\\
$10\% concentration = 100,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \frac{mg}{l}$\\
$5\% concentration = 50,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \frac{mg}{l}$\\
$12.5\% concentration = 125,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \frac{mg}{l}$

\subsection{Example Problems}
% \hl{Example Problems}\\

Problem 1\\Calculate the lbs/day of solids entering the plant given the influent flow is 5 MGD with an average solids concentration  of 250 mg/l.\\

Solution:\\

Applying lbs formula:\\
$\dfrac{lbs}{day}=5 MGD *250\dfrac{mg}{l}*8.34 = \boxed{10,425\dfrac{lbs}{day}}$
\\
Problem 2\\Calculate the lbs of solids in the primary sludge if the sludge flow is 7500 gallons and the solids concentration is 4.5\%.\\
Solution\\
Applying lbs formula:\\
$lbs \enspace solids = \dfrac{7500}{1,000,000}MG * 4.5*10,000 *8.34 = \boxed{2,815 \enspace lbs \enspace solids}$\\
\textbf{Note:}\\  
1) 7500 gallons was converted to MG by dividing by 1,000,000\\
$7500 \enspace gallons * \dfrac{1 MG}{1,000,000 \enspace gallon}$\\
2) 4.5\% was converted to mg/l by multiplying by 10,000 as 1\%=10,000mg/l

% 	\item \noindent\textsc{Process Removal Efficiency}
% \end{snugshade*}
\begin{itemize}
\item Process removal rate or removal efficiency is the percentage of the inlet concentration removed.  
\item It is used for quantifying the pollutant removal during wastewater treatment and is established based upon the amount of a particular wastewater constituent entering and leaving a treatment process.

\item $Process \enspace Removal \enspace Rate \enspace (\%) = \dfrac{Pollutant \enspace  In-Pollutant\enspace  Out}{Pollutant \enspace In}*100$\\

\item If 10 units of a pollutant are entering a process and 8 units of pollutant are leaving (process removes 2 units), then the process removal rate for that pollutant is (10-8)/10*100=20\%.  In this example the process is 20\% efficient in removing that particular pollutant.

\item The amount of pollutant can be measured in terms of concentration (mg/l) or in terms of mass loading (lbs).  The pounds formula is used for calculating the mass loadings.  
\end{itemize}
The above example is for calculating the removal efficiency using the inlet and outlet concentrations or mass loading.\\
The methods below can be used for calculating either the inlet or outlet pollutant concentrations, if the removal efficiency and the corresponding inlet or outlet concentrations are given.

$\implies Actual \enspace  Outlet (X) = 0.4 * 80 = \boxed{32 mg/l}$\\

$\implies 0.0975X=20 \implies X=\dfrac{20}{0.0975}=\boxed{205\dfrac{mg}{l}}$\\

\hspace{2.8cm}$\downarrow$ {\tiny(0.35X)BOD Removed}\hspace{2.2cm}$\downarrow$ {\tiny(0.65X*0.85)BOD Removed}\\

Primary Effluent BOD = Influent BOD * (1-Primary BOD Removal), and\\
Secondary Effluent BOD=[Primary Effluent BOD]*(1-Secondary BOD Removal)\\
Secondary Eff. BOD=[Influent BOD * (1-Primary BOD Removal)]*(1-Secondary BOD Removal)\\

Therefore, 20 = [X*(1-0.35)] * (1-0.85)= X*0.65*0.15\\
$\implies 20 \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}= 0.0975X \implies X=\dfrac{20}{0.0975}=\boxed{205 \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}}$

			\item The principal organic compounds present in domestic wastewater are proteins, carbohydrates and fats together with the products of their decomposition.
			\item Organics are subject to decay or decomposition through the activity of bacteria and other living organisms.  \hl{Since the organic fraction can be driven off at high temperatures, they are also called \textbf{volatile solids}}.\

			      		\item The test involves incubating a known dilution of wastewater in a 300 ml bottle for 5 days at 20\si{\degree}C.  The dissolved oxygen (DO) content at the start and end of the incubation period is used for calculating the BOD.
			      		\item For the test to be considered valid, the following criteria need to be met: 1) DO consumption during the test must be at least 2 mg/l, 2) DO remaining at the end of the test must be at least 1 mg/l, and 3) DO consumed in blank should be 0.2 mg/l or less
			      		      			
			      		\item BOD is a parameter to measure the strength of wastewater and the measurement of the wastewater treatment plant or treatment process influent and effluent BOD is standard practice to measure its performance.  Typical domestic wastewater BOD is about 200-250 mg/l.
			      		\item The oxygen consumed by the microorganisms during the BOD test is primarily for: 1) Oxidizing the carbonaceous material (cBOD – carbonaceous BOD), and 2) Oxidizing nitrogenous constituents such as ammonia (nBOD – nitrogenous BOD).
			      		\item Thus, BOD (Total) = cBOD + nBOD.  The cBOD and nBOD is measured by adding certain chemical inhibitors which will inhibit the bacteria responsible for consuming the nitrogenous matter, thus measuring only the cBOD as part of the BOD test.
			      		\item Since not all of the organics is metabolized in the 5 days of the regular BOD test, certain wastewater discharge permits require reporting of the ultimate BOD value (BOD$_U$)\\

% 			\item \noindent\textsc{Solids}
% 		\end{snugshade*}	
		Like BOD, wastewater solids is another critical parameter for establishing the wastewater strength and determining treatment process efficiencies. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The \texthl{solids can be classified as suspended or dissolved} based upon its ability to pass through a standardized filter paper.
			\item When the wastewater is filtered:
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item the residual solids remaining on the filter paper after drying in an oven at 103\si{\degree}C is the \hl{suspended solids} portion, and 
			      	\item the solids remaining after drying the filtrate are the \hl{dissolved solids}.
			      \end{itemize}
			\item Suspended solids include larger floating particles and consist of sand, grit, clay, fecal matter, paper, pieces of wood, particles of food and garbage, and similar materials.
			\item Suspended solids can be categorized based upon its settling characteristics as:
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item \hl{Settleable}
			      	\item \hl{Non-settleable}
			      	      \begin{itemize}
			      	      	\item \hl{Colloidial}-small, charged (typically negative) particles which do not settle easily.  Some of the colloidial particles are small enough to pass through the filter paper used for filtering the suspended solids
			      	      	\item \hl{Floatable}-example oil and grease and small plastics
			      	      \end{itemize}
			      \end{itemize}
			\item Dissolved solids in wastewater include organics.  However, the major elements of dissolved solids are inorganic ions such as Ca$^{+2}$, Mg$^{+2}$, Cl$^-$, SO$_4$ $^{-2}$ , HCO$_3$ $^-$, Fe$^{+2}$, PO$_4$ $^{-3}$, NO$_3$ $^-$.  These ions are part of the dissolved salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO$_3$)$_2$), magnesium phosphate (Mg$_3$PO$_4$) and others which are normally present in water and wastewater. 
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item Conductivity or electrical conductance (EC) measurement is typically conducted as the wastewater enters the plant as \hl{conductivity provides an indirect and simple measure of the amount of dissolved solids present.}  
			      	\item Conductivity or electrical conductance (EC) is a measure the amount of electrical current that can be conducted by a solution.  
			      	\item The conductance of electricity in a solution is due to the presence of dissolved inorganic ions 
			      	\item The higher the concentration of these ions, the higher is the conductivity. 
			      	\item \underline{Conductivity is measured in the units of mhos/cm or Siemens/cm.}  (Note:  mhos is the reverse of ohm which is a measure of resistance).
			      	\item Typical wastewater conductivities range from 50 to 1500 S/cm
			      \end{itemize}
			\item Both suspended and dissolved solids can be either \hl{volatile (organic)} or \hl{fixed (inorganic)}.
			\item \hl{Total Solids is thus a sum of TSS and dissolved solids or volatile and fixed solids.}
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item The volatile solids are typically of plant or animal origin .
			      	\item The fixed solids include sand, gravel and silt as well as the dissolved salts.
			      \end{itemize}
			      \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
			      	\item The volatile or fixed fractions are quantified by incinerating the solids in a muffler furnace at 550\si{\degree} which removes only the volatile solids leaving only the fixed solids behind.
			      	\item In terms of the size of the solids, the distribution is approximately thirty percent suspended and about seventy percent dissolved solids - which includes the colloidal particles which have passed through the filter paper.\\ 
			      	\item As primary treatment process involve settling of solids, establishing the settleable portion of the suspended solids is important.\\  
			      	\item \hl{The settleable solids are quantified using an Imhoff cone and are reported in ml/L}.  Imhoff cone is a 1 liter, clear cone shaped container, with volume graduations (ml) at the bottom.

			      	\end{center}
		      \end{minipage}
%			      \end{minipage}
			      	\item One factor which affects settleability is the conveyance time of the sewage to the treatment plant. 			
			      	\item The settleable component of the suspended solids will decrease as the sewage becomes more septic due to longer conveyance times.
			\item Influent and effluent total suspended solids are measured to establish the overall treatment and individual process efficiencies.  
			\item Volatile solids measurements before and after biological processes such as secondary treatment and digestion provide information on the process efficiency.\\

The ammonium nitrogen is present either in the form of ammonia (NH$_3$ ) or as ammonium (NH$_4^+$ ) ion.   These two forms can rapidly change from one to the other depending on pH and temperature.  Under low pH (acidic) or neutral conditions – pH less than or equal to 7, ammonia exists mostly as ammonium.  Ammonia becomes the dominant form as the pH increases to 8 and beyond.

\section{Wastewater Parameters}\index{Wastewater Parameters}			
		Laboratory and field tests are conducted to measure parameters which are critical for monitoring and controlling treatment.  The following are the key parameters that are measured.	
			
\subsection{pH}\index{pH}	
			\hl{pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion (H$^+$) content or the acidity or basicity of a solution.}  pH impacts the chemical and micribiological elements of wastewater treatment processes and thus pH measurement and control is critical.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Pure water dissociates into equal concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions:\\ 
				      $H_2O \rightarrow H^+ + OH^-$.
				\item The H$^+$ are responsible for acidic properties and the OH$^-$ ions for the basic properties.  
				\item pH is the inverse of H$^+$ concentration; pH increases when the concentration of H$^+$ decreases relative to the concentration of OH-. 
				\item pH scale ranges from 0 – 14. When the concentration of both H$^+$ and OH$^-$ are equal, as in pure water, it is considered neutral and its pH is 7.0.  \item If the pH of a sample solution is below 7.0, the sample is termed acidic and is alkaline or basic if its pH is above 7.0. 
				\item Each change of 1 pH unit represents a 10 fold change in concentration.  For example, a sample with a pH of 2.0 is 1000 times more acidic than a sample with a pH of 5.0. 
				\item pH is measured by an electrode that is sensitive only to H$^+$ or using a pH strip which is essentially an adsorbent paper which is pre-impregnated with chemicals which change color under different H$^+$ concentrations.
				\item Most organisms involved in biological wastewater treatment processes do well within a a narrow range of pH near neutral (pH of 7).			
			\end{itemize}
			
\subsection{Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP)}\index{Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP)}			
			ORP is a measure of the potential of a wastewater to allow for microbiological oxidation and reduction reactions.\\
			An example of wastewater treatment process where microbiological oxidation involved include the activated sludge process.  Whereas, anaerobic digestion is a microbiological reduction based process.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item ORP value is measured in millivolts (mV), using an electrochemical probe
				\item The measured ORP value provides an indication of the potential of oxidation and reduction reactions in that sample.
				\item A higher positive ORP is indicative of oxidation potential of the wastewater whereas a negative ORP value indicates potential for a reduction reaction to occur.
				\item ORP measurements are used for controlling treatment processes including nitrification, odor control and disinfection.  For example, in the disinfection process utilizing chlorine (bleach), ORP measurements provides the strength of the oxidation potential of chlorine present in the wastewater being disinfected.  This measurement is used for precisely controlling the chlorine dosing.  The proper chlorine control results in optimizing chlorine dosing which reduces potential toxicity issues and dechlorination costs.
			\end{itemize}
			Typical ORP applications include the following processes and process elements

					\small Anaerobic Digestion: Acid formation (Acidogenesis)           & \small -100 to -225 mV \\
					\small Anaerobic Digestion: Methane production (Methanogenesis)     & \small -75 to -400 mV  \\
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
				
			\end{center}
			
\subsection{Alkalinity}\index{Alkalinity}	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \hl{Alkalinity is the ability of a water to neutralize acids.}  
				\item During certain wastewater treatment processes including anaerobic digestion, acids are generated as a result of microbiological activity.  The bacteria and other biological entities which play an active role in wastewater treatment are most effective at a neutral to slightly alkaline pH of 7 to 8.  In order to maintain these optimal pH conditions for biological activity there must be sufficient alkalinity present in the wastewater to neutralize acids generated by the active biomass.
				\item This ability to maintain the proper pH in the wastewater as it undergoes treatment is the reason why alkalinity is so important to the wastewater industry.
				\item The alkalinity is due to the presence of acid neutralizing bases in the water including the hydroxyl (OH$^-$), carbonate (CO$_3$$^-$) and bicarbonate (HCO$_3$$^-$)  ions.  These ions are of mineral origin and are also formed from carbon dioxide which comes from the atmosphere and from the microbial decomposition of organic material.  The resistance to pH change of the water will continue until all the alkalinity contributing ions are neutralized.  
				\item The pH of a water serves as a guide to the types of alkalinity present in the water but is unrelated to the alkalinity content of a water.  Important Note:  Alkalinity is a measure of the ability to neutralize acids whereas a solution is termed alkaline (or basic) if its pH greater than 7. 
				\item Alkalinity is expressed as milligrams per liter of CaCO$_3$
			\end{itemize}
			
\subsection{Dissolved Oxygen}\index{Dissolved Oxygen}	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the wastewater sample and is typically measured in the field using a DO probe.  A titration based Winkler Test is used in the laboratory
				\item The \hl{presence of oxygen indicates an aerobic environment} where dissolved, free oxygen is available for aerobic microorganisms to live, BOD removal in the activated sludge process occurs as a result of the activity of aerobic bacteria.  The absence of DO indicates that the environment or condition is either anoxic or anaerobic.  
				\item \hl{In an anoxic environment, free oxygen is not present, but oxygen is available from its combined  forms - nitrate (NO$_3$ $^-$) and sulfate (SO$_4$ $^-$)} for the the consumption of microorganisms.  Example of an anoxic process is denitrification.  In denitrification, the anoxic bacteria in the presence of food (cBOD) consume the combined oxygen in nitrates (NO$_3$ $^-$ ) and convert it to nitrogen gas.
				\item \hl{The complete absence of oxygen including free and combined oxygen is an anaerobic environment.}
				\item Microorganisms are termed as obligate aerobes if they cannot survive without free oxygen.  Facultative aerobes are microorganisms which can survive in both aerobic and anaerobic environments.  
			\end{itemize}
			
\subsection{Microbiological testing and monitoring}\index{Microbiological testing and monitoring}	
			
			Microbiological testing and monitoring is conducted as part of the wastewater treatment for two main reasons:
			\begin{enumerate}[1.]
				\item Heterotrohic (organisms that consume organic material) microbes are responsible for the biological wastewater treatment processes - secondary treatment process, digestion and nutrient removal; and
				\item Pathogens - agents that cause disease are present in wastewater effluent.
			\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
				
				\item Microbiological testing related to monitoring and troubleshooting biological wastewater treatment\\
				
				Microbes involved in biological wastewater treatment processes include:\\
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Fungi - Filamentous fungi occasionally bloom in activated sludge processes due to low pH or nutrient deficiency and cause problems with the settleability.
					\item Protozoa - Protozoas play a important role in the secondary treatment process.  Common protozoas in the activated sludge process include:
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item Amoeba
					      	\item Flagellate
					      	\item Cilliate
					      \end{itemize}
					\item Rotifers
					\item Nematodes
					\item Bacteria - Bacteria is the predominant microorganism responsible for the biological wastewater water treatment.  
				\end{itemize}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The effectiveness of the biological wastewater treatment processes is primarily due to the presence of a microbial ecosystem with a right balance of populations of different microbial species.
					\item Methods used for monitoring the microbial composition include direct monitoring using a light microscope to see which and how many of the different microbial species are present - typically used for activated sludge process.
					\item Indirect method includes monitoring other parameters such as pH and alkalinity which are influenced by microbiological activity.
					\item The microbial monitoring ensures process stability and helps identify potential process upset conditions caused by changes to the microbial population due to other external factors - toxicty, organic loading, temperature etc.
				\end{itemize}

\item Microbiological testing related to monitoring and controlling pathogens in treated wastewater effluent\\

	
				Pathogens in wastewater belong to the following groups:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Bacteria:  Although, bacteria is present in large numbers in feces, pathogenic or bacteria are present only because of an infection and this pathogenic bacteria can potentially spread the infection to other healthy individuals.  Disease spread by pathogenic bacteria include diarrhea, cholera and typhoid among many others.
					      
					\item Viruses: A large number of viruses may infect humans and are present in feces.  These include enteroviruses (including polioviruses), hepatitis A virus, reoviruses and diarrhea-causing viruses (especially rotavirus).
					      
					\item Protozoa:  Many species of protozoa can infect humans and cause diarrhoea and dysentery. Girardia which casues diarrheal illness is an example of a protozoan pathogen
					      
					\item Helminths:  These are parasitic worms that can infect humans and are transmitted to others through its eggs or larval forms
					      
				\end{itemize}
				
				\begin{itemize}
					\item As one of the main reasons for treating wastewater is to protect public health, microbiological/pathogen testing of the wastewater effluent and the surface water impacted by the wastewater discharge is conducted to meet the requirements of a wastewater discharge permit, to monitor the pathogen impact of treated wastewater discharge and assess the level of contamination of a public body of water.
					\item The bacteriological tests involves detection and quantification of one or more of the following bacteria:  total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. Coli, and Enterococcus.  
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item The main reason why these bacteria such as coliforms and enterococcus are used \hl{as it is not practical to detect and quantify all pathogens associated with wastewater.}  
					      	\item These selected bacteria originate from feces and indicate fecal contamination and thus serve as an indicator organisms for pathogens of wastewater origin.  
					      	\item Also, they are abundant, potentially less harmful, and easy to detect.  E. coli has been shown to be a better predictor of the potential for impacts to human health and therefore many newer wastewater discharge permits require E. Coli testing in lieu of fecal coliform testing requirements.
					      \end{itemize}
					\item The microbiological test sample is always collected as a grab in a clean, sterile borosilicate glass or plastic bottle containing sodium thiosulfate. 
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item Sodium thiosulfate is added to remove residual chlorine which will kill coliforms during transit. 
					      	\item If the sample is not preserved or maintained under proper conditions until the test is conducted in the laboratory, the test would provide erroneous results.
					      	\item Samples must be refrigerated if they cannot be analyzed within 1 hour of collection and must be handled with care to prevent contamination and adverse conditions such as prolonged exposure to direct sunlight.
					      	\item The maximum holding time for state or federal permit reporting purposes is 6 hours. 
					      \end{itemize} 
					\item As it is not possible to exactly quantify the number of bacteria present, a statistical based - \hl{Most Probable Number (MPN)} approach is utilized.  The methods for wastewater bacteriological tests include:  multiple-tube fermentation technique, membrane filtration and quanti-tray testing.

\subsection{Specific Gravity}\index{Specific Gravity}				
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Specific gravity is a term to express the weight of a solution with respect to that of water
				\item Water weighs 1 kg/L or 8.34 lbs/gallon or 62.4 lbs/ft$^3$
				\item A solution with a specific gravity of 1.2 will weigh 1.2 times the same volume of water.  1 L of that solution will weigh ( 1.2 kg )/L  or  ( 1.2*8.34=10lbs )/gallon.
				\item Typically wastewater and the associated unthickened sludge, for all practical purposes is assumed to have a specific gravity of 1 - implying 8.34 lbs/gallon.
				\item Specific gravity is typically used for calculations related to chemicals used in wastewater treatment.
			\end{itemize}
			
\section{Wastewater Sampling}\index{Wastewater Sampling}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Field or laboratory measurement of a certain parameter is critical in wastewater treatment operations to obtain information about wastewater characteristics in order to either characterize a wastewater stream, or to monitor a treatment process or for permit compliance.  
			\item A sample is a small part of the whole representing the whole.  Thus, a sample needs to be such that it truly represents the entire population – which in a wastewater operations could be either a wastewater stream, wastewater solids or a chemical used.
		\end{itemize}
		
\subsection{Sampling Methods}\index{Sampling Methods}
\subsubsection{Grab Samples}\index{Grab Samples}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item A grab sample is a sample collected at a specific spot at a site over a short period of time.  
					\item Grab sampling allows for instantaneous analysis of parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorine residual, temperature and other parameters which change rapidly with time.
					\item A grab sample represents a snapshot of space and time of a process stream.
					\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Composite Samples}\index{Composite Samples}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item A composite sample is a collection of discrete samples are combined over a certain period or space and therefore represent the average performance of a wastewater treatment plant or a process during the collection period.\\  
					\item Composite sampling can be either based on:
					      
					      1. constant time interval (time proportioned sampling)\\
					      2. constant wastewater volume interval (flow-proportioned sampling), and\\
					      3. treatment process space - includes samples taken at different depths\\
					      
					\item Composite samples are typically collected using automated samplers which can be programmed to collect samples at pre-established time intervals – for time proportional sampling.
					\item Time and space composite samples are collected by adding equal volumes of samples collected from different times or locations.  
					\item Flow proportional composite samples comprise of volume of each subsample based on flow.\\

\subsubsection{Sampling Precautions and Protocols}\index{Sampling Precautions and Protocols}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Samples should represent the major portion of the process or the process stream and should be taken from places where the mixing is thorough, avoiding dead spots and areas of heavier or lighter loadings. 
				\item The collected sample is invariably exposed to conditions very different from the original source and is subject to change due to chemical and microbiological activity.  
				\item Thus, in order to ensure integrity of sample, sample preservation techniques specific to the analysis to be performed is needed.  
				      \begin{itemize}
				      	\item The preservation technique should not only allow for stabilizing the parameter to be analyzed, it should also not interfere with the analyses.  
				      	\item The common preservation techniques involve use of proper containers, temperature control, addition of chemical preservatives, and observance of the recommended maximum sample holding time.

\section{Data Reporting}\index{Data Reporting}	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Arithmetic mean is typically calculated for reporting data where multiple samples have been collected and analyzed for the same process stream at different times and for reporting average value over a certain time period – daily, monthly etc.\\ \item Arithmetic mean mathematically is calculated by adding all the result values and dividing by the total number of data points.\\
		\end{itemize}
		Mathematically the arithmetic mean is represented as:\\
		$$\bar{x}=\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x^i}{n} = \dfrac{x_1+x_2+x_3...x_n}{n}$$
		For example:\\
		Arithmetic mean of the following set of data points:  200, 304, 250, 400 is calculated as:\\
		\vspace{10pt}
		Arithmetic Mean = $\dfrac{200 + 302 + 250 + 400}{4}= 288$\\
		\vspace{10pt}
		For data sets for analysis such as fecal coliform could include values which vary by several orders of magnitudes, using the arithmetic mean to report the average value is not appropriate as the lower or higher values would bias the calculated mean.\\
		\vspace{10pt}
		For example, consider a data set with values:  260, 300, 500, 5,000, 320 and 200.\\
		\vspace{10pt}
		The arithmetic mean = $\dfrac{260+300+500+5,000+320+200}{6} = 3,444$\\
		Here the 5000 value completely skews the arithmetic mean.
		
		Therefore, for such tests, the geometric mean calculation is used for reporting the average value.\\
		
		
		Mathematically a geometric mean is represented as:\\
		$$\Bigg(\prod_{i=a}^n\Bigg)^{\dfrac{1}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a_1*a_2*a_3...a_n}$$
		 
		Calculation method:\\
		1.	Find the product of all the data points (analogous to first calculating the sum of all the data points when calculating the arithmetic mean)\\
		260*300*500*5,000*320*200 = 12,480,000,000,000,000\\
		2.	Raise the product to the inverse of the number of data points\\
		(*Using the power function of a scientific calculator)\\
		Here n (\# data points) = 6 $\implies$ geometric mean = $(12,480,000,000,000,000)^{\dfrac{1}{6}}   = 482$
