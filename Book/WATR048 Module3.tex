\chapter{Introduction to Secondary Treatment}
\begin{itemize}
\item While preliminary and primary treatment processes are designed primarily to remove solids from wastewater, secondary treatment is for the removal of organics.
\item Secondary treatment involves:
\begin{itemize}
\item biological conversion of the dissolved and suspended organics in wastewater into biomass, and
\item physical settling (separation) process where the solids including the biomass formed during secondary treatment is separated and removed from the treated wastewater.
\end{itemize}

\item With the removal of gross solids in the preliminary treatment followed by removable of settleable solids in the primary clarifiers and the removal of dissolved and suspended organics in the secondary treatment processes, the wastewater is considered treated.
\item Secondary treated wastewater is typically disposed or treated further for reuse or disposal (depending upon the end use/application and the NPDES permit stipulations).
\item The solids (biomass) removed from the secondary treatment is typically mixed with the solids from primary treatment and stabilized using a solids treatment process like sludge digestion prior to its disposal.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Secondary treatment process incorporates one of the following three approaches:}


\section{Fixed film system}\index{Fixed Film System}	

\begin{itemize}
\item Here the microorganisms responsible for the treatment, grow on substrates such
as rocks, sand or plastic.
\item When the wastewater is spread over the substrate, the microorganisms up-take the organics present in the wastewater
\item Example of this secondary treatment process include trickling filters and rotating biological contactors\\
\end{itemize}

\section{Suspended Growth System}\index{Suspended Growth System}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this type of secondary treatment, the microbes are suspended in the
wastewater flow being treated. 
\item Air or oxygen is supplied to maintain an aerobic environment and to keep the microorganisms in suspension. 
\item Example of this secondary treatment approach include the activated sludge treatment process 
\end{itemize}

\section{Pond System}\index{Pond System}
Similar to the suspended growth, stabilization ponds are large man made bodies of water which treat wastewater using mainly natural processes including sunlight, algae and microorganisms.

\chapter{Trickling Filters}




\section{Theoretical Background}\index{Theoretical Background}
		
Trickling filter is a fixed film secondary treatment process wherein the organic content of the wastewater is removed using biological growth attached to an inert media such as lava rock or plastic\\			
\begin{itemize}
\item In a trickling filter, the wastewater is sprayed evenly on the surface of the media with a rotary type distributor with orifices
\item The wastewater percolates through the media bed, where it comes in contact with biological slime growth – zoogleal film (zooglea)
\item The aerobic biomass - bacteria, protozoa and other microoorganisms in the zooglea capture and consume the suspended and dissolved organics from the wastewater.
\item The microorganisms metabolize the organics and in the process produce more microbial mass resulting in increasing the thickness of the zoogleal layer.
\item The thickness of the zoogleal layer can only increase to a point until the wastewater flow – hydraulic load, shears the slime layer – “sloughs off” and is carried out as part of the effluent flow as sloughing.
\item The treated wastewater cascades from the bottom of the media into the underdrain system – lower portion of the TF comprised of columns which support the media base.  The underdrain has a sloping floor to direct the cascading water into a center channel .
\item The clarifier allows for the separation (settling) of the  of the solids (sloughed off material).  The settled solids is removed - typically pumped to a digester and the clarified effluent flows out of the clarifier.
\item The source of oxygen to support the aerobic growth is from the oxygen dissolved in the wastewater as it is sprayed over the media and from the air currents due to the downward flow of the wastewater and the temperature difference between ambient and the interior of the trickling filter.  Forced ventilation system may be designed as part of the trickling filter

\item Word trickling “filter” is a misnomer - no filtration is involved
\item Advantage includes process simplicity and lower costs
\item Disadvantage include BOD removal efficiency of only about 80-85%
\item The media may be rock, slag, coal, bricks, redwood blocks, molded plastic, or any other sound durable material.
\item The media depth ranges from about three to eight feet for rock media trickling filters and 15 to 30 feet for synthetic media.
\item The media needs to be uniformly sized and have adequate empty spaces (voids) to ensure maintaining aerobic condition necessary for the survival of biomass.  

\item Pre-fabricated (synthetic) media - similar to the one shown below, has an advantage over the "dumped" type media such as lava rock of providing a greater surface area per volume upon which the zoologeal film may grow while providing ample void space for the free circulation of air.

\item Sometimes, due to inadequate hydraulic loading, portions of the zoogleal layer may become too thick and oxygen cannot penetrate its full depth, causing odor issues.

\end{itemize}


\section{Trickling Filter Recirculation}\index{Trickling Filter Recirculation}

Recirculation - where a portion of the treated wastewater is returned back as the feed to the TF.  The parameter recirculation ratio is calculated to quantify the recirculation flow.  Recirculation ratio is a ratio of the recirculated flow - Q$_R$ to the influent flow Q$_I$. Recirculation ratios typically vary from 0.5 to 4.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{TFrecirculation}
\end{center}
Recirculation is beneficial for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item It improves the removal efficiency by increasing the contact time of the zoogleal layer with the wastewater
\item During low flows it prevents the trickling filter from drying out
\item It dilutes any toxic loadings
\item It promotes oxygen transfer and reduces ponding
\item The increased hydraulic loading promotes uniform sloughing, prevents ponding, improves ventilation through the filter and reduces potential for snail and filter fly breeding
\end{itemize}
\section{Operation of Multiple Trickling Filters}\index{Operation of Multiple Trickling Filters}

Multiple trickling filters can be operated in series or in parallel:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Series operation in which the flow from one flows into the next.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{TFSeries1}
\end{center}  
\begin{itemize}
\item For high strength loading and for nitrification
\end{itemize}
\item Parallel operation in which the trickling filters that are operated side by side.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{TFParallel1}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item For winter operation - prevents freezing in the TF
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Parameters for monitoring and operating trickling filters}\index{Parameters for monitoring and operating trickling filters}



\begin{enumerate}
\item Hydraulic loading is expressed as gpd/$ft^2$
\item BOD Removal (\%)
\item Organic loading lbs BOD/day/ 1000 cu ft
\item Recirculation ratio
\end{enumerate}


\section{Classifying Trickling Filters}\index{Classifying Trickling Filters}			
Trickling filters are classified according to the hydraulic and organic loading applied to the  filter\\

\subsection{Low-rate filter}\index{Low-rate filter}

\begin{itemize}
\item The standard rate or low rate trickling filters (LRTF) are relatively simple treatment units that normally produce a consistent effluent quality even with varying influent strength
\item They are generally not provided with recirculation of effluent
\item Depending upon the dosing system, wastewater is applied intermittently with rest periods which generally do not exceed five minutes at the designed rate of waste flow. 
\item While there is some unloading or sloughing of solids at all times, the major unloadings usually occur several times a year for comparatively short Periods of time.
\end{itemize}

     Hydraulic loading is 25 - 100 gal/day/sq. ft\\
     BOD Removal (\%) 	50 – 80\%\\
     Organic loading is 5 - 25 lbs BOD/day/1000 cu ft\\

\subsection{High-rate filter}\index{High-rate filter}

\begin{itemize}
\item The most important element of a high-rate trickling filter is the provision where a part of the settled treated effluent is pumped to the PST or to the filter.  This is termed as \textbf{Recirculation}
\item High-rate filters are usually characterized by higher hydraulic and organic loadings than low-rate filters
\item The higher BOD loading is accomplished by applying a larger volume of waste per unit surface area of the filter.  \item As a result of the higher flow velocities a more continuous and uniform sloughing of excess zoogleal growth occurs
\end{itemize}

     Hydraulic loading is 100 - 1000 gal/day/sq. ft\\
     BOD Removal (\%) 	65 - 85\%\\
     Organic loading is 25 - 100 lbs BOD/day/ 1000 cu ft\\
			
\subsection{Roughing filter}\index{Roughing filter}

\begin{itemize}
\item Roughing filters are high rate type filters designed with plastic packing
\item In most cases roughing filters are used to treat wastewater prior to secondary treatment
\item One of the advantages of roughing filter is low energy requirement for BOD removal of high strength wastewaters as compared to activated sludge process because the energy required is only for pumping the influent wastewater and recirculation flows
\end{itemize}



\section{Trickling Filter Operational Issues}\index{Trickling Filter Operational Issues}

\subsection{Ponding}\index{Ponding}


If the voids in the media get plugged, flow can collect on the surface in ponds.
Correction:
spraying the surface with high pressure water stream
stopping a rotary distributor over the ponded area
hand-stir the media or open the voids
dose the filter with chlorine for several hours

\subsection{Odors}\index{Odors}


\begin{itemize}
\item Corrective measures should be taken immediately if foul odors develop
\item presence of foul odors indicates anaerobic conditions are predominant
\item Check the under drain system for obstructions or heavy biological growths
\item increase the recirculation rate to provide more oxygen to the filter bed and increase sloughing 
\item keep slime growths off of sidewalks and inside walls of the filter to reduce the odor
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trickling Filter Flies - Psychoda}\index{Trickling Filter Flies - Psychoda}

\begin{itemize}
\item tiny, gnat-size filter fly, or Psychoda - primary nuisance insect
\item Correction methods include
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase recirculation rate
\item keep orifice openings clear
\item apply insecticides to filter walls
\item dose filter with chlorine
\item keep weeds and tall grass cut around filter
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cold weather problems}\index{Cold weather problems}

\begin{itemize}
\item ice can form on the media of the filter
\item Correction methods include:
\begin{itemize}
\item decrease recirculation to the filter (influent is usually warmer than recycled flows)
\item construct wind screens
\item operate two-stage filters in parallel rather than in series
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Math Problems}\index{Math Problems}

Trickling filter problems involve calculation of the following:

\subsection{Hydraulic or surface loading}\index{Hydraulic or surface loading}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hydraulic or surface loading is expressed as gpd/$ft^2$
\item \hl{The gpd is the total flow (Q$_T$)to the filter - primary influent flow + recirculated flow(Q$_T$= Q$_I$ + Q$_R$)}\\
\end{itemize}
			\hl{Example Problem:}\\
The total influent flow (including recirculation) to a trickling filter is 1.89 MGD. If the trickling filter is 80 ft in diameter, what is the hydraulic loading in gpd/sq ft on the trickling filter?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Hydraulic \enspace loading \enspace \dfrac{gpd}{ft^2}=\dfrac{(1.89*10^6)gpd}{(0.785*80^2)ft^2} =\boxed{376\dfrac{gpd}{ft^2}}$
			
			
\subsection{BOD and TSS Removal}\index{BOD and TSS Removal}
BOD and  removal is based upon the TF influent and effluent concentrations.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\% Removal=\dfrac{In_{conc}-Out_{conc}}{In_{conc}}*100$\\
			\hl{Example Problem:}\\
The suspended solids concentration entering a trickling filter is 236 mg/l. If the suspended solids concentration of the trickling filter effluent is 33 mg/l, what is the suspended solids removal efficiency of the trickling filter?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\% Removal=\dfrac{236 mg/l-33 mg/l}{236 mg/l}*100=\boxed{86\%}$

\subsection{Organic Loading}\index{Organic Loading}

			\begin{itemize}
\item Organic loading to a trickling filter is typically expressed as lbs BOD/(day-1000 cu ft).  \item The lbs/day BOD value is the BOD loading from the primary effluent.
\item The 1000 ct. ft is the volume of the media.  
\item The media volume is calculated by multiplying the TF surface area by the media height.  
\item As the dimensions are typically given in ft., calculate the volume in $ft^3$ and then divide the calculated volume by 1000 to give the volume in units of 1000$ft^3$\\
\end{itemize}
\hl{Example Problem:}\\
A trickling filter, 70 ft in diameter with a media depth of 6 ft, receives a flow of 0.78 MGD. If the BOD concentration of the primary effluent is 167 mg/L, what is the organic loading on the trickling filter in lbs BOD/day/1000 cu ft?\\
Solution:  $Organic \enspace loading:\dfrac{lbs \enspace BOD}{day-1000ft^3}=\dfrac{lbs \enspace BOD \enspace feed \enspace to \enspace TF \enspace per \enspace day}{volume \enspace in \enspace 1000ft^3}$\\
$=\dfrac{\dfrac{(0.78*167*8.34)lbs \enspace BOD}{day}}{(0.785*70^2*6)ft^3*\dfrac{1000ft^3}{1000ft^3}}=\boxed{\dfrac{47 lbs \enspace BOD}{day-1000 ft^3}}$

\subsection{Recirculation Ratio}\index{Recirculation Ratio}


$Recirculation \enspace Ratio (R_R)=\dfrac{Recirculated \enspace Flow (Q_R)}{Influent  \enspace  Flow (Q_I)}$\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
$Recirculation \enspace Ratio (R_R)=\dfrac{Total \enspace Flow (Q_T) - Influent \enspace Flow (Q_I)}{Influent  \enspace  Flow (Q_I)}$\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
$Total \enspace Flow (Q_T) = Influent \enspace Flow (Q_I)*(Recirculation \enspace Ratio(R_R) +1)$
Make sure $Q_R$, $Q_T$ and $Q_I$ units are the same in a given problem

\hl{Example Problems:}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item The influent to the trickling filter is 1.61 MGD. If the recirculated flow is 2.27 MGD, what is the recirculation ratio?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:  $R_R=\dfrac{Q_R}{Q_I}=\dfrac{2.27}{1.61}=\boxed{1.4}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item A trickling filter has a total flow of 32 MGD.  If the recirculation ratio is 0.8, what is the primary effluent flow to the TF?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Total \enspace Flow (Q_T) = Influent \enspace Flow (Q_I)*(Recirculation \enspace Ratio(R_R) +1)$\\
$\implies 32 MGD=Q_I*(0.8+1)\implies Q_I=\dfrac{32}{1.8}=\boxed{17.8 MGD}$

\chapter{Stabilzation Ponds}
% Chapter heading image

\begin{itemize}
\item Stabilization ponds and lagoons are bodies of water which treat wastewater using mainly natural processes including sunlight, algae and microorganisms for treating wastewater\\
\item While ponds are shallow and man-made, lagoons are bodies of water confined within natural boundaries.\\
\end{itemize}


\section{Advantages of ponds}\index{Advantages of ponds}	

\begin{itemize}	
\item Cheap to build and operate
\item Low maintenance and electrical costs
\item Do not require highly trained operational personnel
\item Provide treatment that can be equal to some secondary treatment processes and have fewer sludge handling issues.\\
\end{itemize}


\section{Disadvantages of ponds}\index{Disadvantages of ponds}	
\begin{itemize}	
\item Land intensive
\item Effluent quality varies with seasonal temperature changes
\item Suspended solids levels that can create regulatory problems.
\item System upsets almost always result in odor problems and recovery times may be weeks or months.
\item Not appropriate for colder climates
\item Not always appropriate for colder climates
\end{itemize} 

\section{Types of Ponds}\index{Types of Ponds}	

\subsection{Anaerobic Ponds}\index{Anaerobic Ponds}	

\begin{itemize}	
\item Typically for treating raw sewage
\item Designed for BOD removal
\item 10-14 feet deep. 
\item High strength wastewater may be treated
\item Utilize anaerobic bacteria to break down the organic waste. 
\item Septic conditions in the lagoon and odors associated with septic sewer gases particularly hydrogen sulfide and its rotten egg odor. 
\item Most of the decomposition is accomplished by acid forming bacteria. 
\item The pH in these lagoons is usually below 6.5. 
\item They are total retention and do not have an effluent discharge. 
\item The anaerobic pond must be de-sludged approximately once every 2 to 5 years
\item Organic loading of 200-1000 lbs. $BOD_5$ per acre per day
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Facultative Ponds}\index{Facultative Ponds}	

\begin{itemize}
\item Typically for secondary treatment - BOD removal
\item Are about 4-7 feet deep
\item 15-50 lbs $BOD_5$ per acre per day.
\item Facultative bacteria are responsible for most of the treatment that occurs in these ponds (facultative bacteria can live under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions)
\item Most common design for lagoon systems that are used to treat raw wastewater. 
\item Designed for a BOD loading rate of 20-35 pounds per acre per day – about 1 surface acre for about 300 – 400 people
\item Suspended solids settle to the bottom of the pond where there is less dissolved oxygen.  
\item The facultative bacteria will become anaerobic to digest these solids. Circulation in the pond will eventually bring these bacteria to the surface where high levels of dissolved oxygen exist. When this occurs, the bacteria will become aerobic to stabilize the dissolved organics that are present.
\item The algae that grow in the lagoon are critical to the successful stabilization of the organic load. 
\item The algae will take in carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and, through photosynthesis, use it to create sugars and release dissolved oxygen ($O_2$) that is used by the aerobic bacteria. Facultative lagoon levels should always maintain at least 4 feet of water in the pond.
\item Unused CO$_2$ will react with water to form carbonic acid - which would reduce the pH unless consumed
\item When the sun goes down, photosynthesis stops. Since there is no uptake of carbon dioxide at night, the pH of the lagoon will slowly drop back to 6.8-7.0.
\item During the day the pH will gradually rise to about 7.2 – 7.6 as the $CO_2$ is consumed
\item \hl{The lowest pH will be just before dawn} 
\item An indication of an overloaded pond is its low pH as the $CO_2$ produced by the bacteria is not consumed by the algae quickly enough
\item Detention times range from 30-60 days. Raising or lowering the operating level can change detention times
\item Sludge removal need is rare.  Sludge can be removed by using a raft-mounted sludge pump or by draining and dewatering the pond and removing the sludge with a front-end loader.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aerobic Stabilization Ponds}\index{Aerobic Stabilization Ponds}
	
Aerobic stabilization ponds are also known as: \hl{maturation}, \hl{polishing} or \hl{finishing} Pond
\begin{itemize}
\item Typically for tertiary treatment
\item Designed for pathogen removal
\item Shallow - only about 3 feet deep. 
\item They are most often the final cells in a multi-staged pond system
\item They are also used as polishing ponds for tertiary treatment of trickling filter plant effluent.
\item Usually the effluent is directed into a second pond where the sludge can settle 
\item Their shallow depth allows sunlight to penetrate to the bottom of the pond to encourage algae growth and aerobic conditions throughout the pond 
\item The low solids loading found in these tertiary treatment applications means that these ponds normally have no sludge zone
\item These ponds may be mechanically aerated 
\item Aerobic polishing ponds are designed for 15-20 pounds BOD/acre/day
\item Aerobic ponds are typically designed for pathogen removal
\item Aerobic lagoon levels should always maintain at least 18 inches of water in the pond
\end{itemize}



\section{Ponds Operations and Maintenance}\index{Ponds Operations and Maintenance}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ponds and lagoons are designed as continuous discharge, controlled discharge, or no discharge.
\begin{itemize}
\item In controlled discharge ponds the wastewater is held for long periods of time before discharging. 

\item No-discharge ponds the inflow rate needs to be equal or exceed the rates of evaporation and/or percolation. 
\end{itemize}
\item Short-circuiting in a pond may be caused by poor design of inlet and outlet piping arrangements or by uncontrolled growth of water weeds.
\item Stagnant water will breed mosquitoes and can result in anaerobic conditions developing that can cause odor issues 
\item Dikes need to be maintained
\item Aquatic plants and weeds must be removed from the water. 
\item Reeds will create stagnant areas along the edge of the pond and need to be removed
\item To start a new pond, two feet of water is typically added prior to fresh starting wastewater feed. 
\item Sodium nitrate can be used to help recover from an odor-causing upset. The nitrates ($NO_3$) will provide a source of chemically bound oxygen for the bacteria to use instead of dissolved oxygen.
\item Scum control may be required
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Activated Sludge}


\section{Activated Sludge Basics}\index{Activated Sludge Basics}

Activated sludge is a secondary, biological treatment process used for the removal of suspended and dissolved organic matter from the primary treated wastewater.
\begin{itemize}
\item Utilizes an aeration basin/reactor and a secondary clarifier

\item In the presence of oxygen, aerobic bacteria in the aeration basin consume the organic matter (BOD) in wastewater for their growth and reproduction, converting BOD into bacterial cell mass along with metabolic byproducts including carbon dioxide and water

\item The aerobic bacteria is the predominant microbial life form in the aeration basin.  Other higher microbial life forms — mainly protozoa, are present along with some metazoans.

\item The microorganisms along with their metabolic byproducts and residual dead cell mass form a cluster called floc.

\item The wastewater exiting the aeration basin enters a clarifier where the floc settles.  The clear, treated secondary effluent flows out.

\item A portion of the settled activated sludge floc, is returned from the clarifier to the front of the aeration basin to seed the activated sludge treatment of the incoming primary effluent. The recycled floc is called \textbf{Return Activated Sludge (RAS)}.

\item The remaining settled floc from the clarifier is ”wasted” \textemdash transferred for solids treatment (typically using digestion) prior to its ultimate disposal. The wasted floc is called \textbf{Waste Activated Sludge (WAS)}.

\item The color of healthy activated sludge is tan to brown with an earthy/musty odor.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{ASProcess}
\end{center}

\item For activated sludge treatment to be effective, it is critical to establish a healthy microbial population which \hl{converts the BOD} into \hl{easily separable biomass.}
\item If the biomass does not settle well in the clarifier, it will be carried out in the treated secondary effluent producing a poor quality effluent with higher solids and organic content.  \\
\end{itemize}

    \begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20] 
\textbf{Mixed liquor}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mixed liquor is the mixture of raw and/or treated wastewater with the biomass.
\item Mixed liquor sample is typically taken at the end of the aeration reactor.
\item In the mixed liquor, the suspended solids comprised mostly of biomass with some undegraded and non-degradable material is called \textbf{Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)}.  
\item The volatile fraction of the MLSS is termed \textbf{Mixed Liquor Volatile Solids (MLVSS)}.  \item The MLVSS is the amount of biomass as a percentage of the MLSS.  Typically, MLVSS is 70 - 80\%, implying that 70-80\% of the MLSS is volatile (organic) solids.
\end{itemize}
    \end{mdframed}

\section{Activated Sludge Process Control Parameters}\index{Activated Sludge Process Control Parameters}

\subsection{Dissolved Oxygen}\index{Dissolved Oxygen}

Maintaining adequate \textbf{Dissolved oxygen (DO)} is key to the activated sludge process.  DO is typically maintained between 0.5 to 3.0 mg/l in the aeration reactor.\\

\subsection{pH}\index{pH}

The microbiological population in the activated sludge is very sensitive to pH and needs to be maintained at neutral - 7 pH.

\subsection{Temperature}\index{Temperature}

Biological activity is temperature dependent.  Microbial activity approximately doubles for every 10$^o$C rise in temperature.\\

\subsection{Food to Mass Ratio (F:M)}\index{Food to Mass Ratio (F:M)}

In order to establish the amount of the MLSS to be maintained in the aeration tank, the parameter \textbf{Food to Mass Ratio (F:M)} is used.  F:M is the ratio of the "food" – the mass of primary effluent BOD entering the aeration basin to the mass of the microorganisms in the aeration basin \textemdash MLVSS.  Common ranges for F:M for a conventional activated sludge plant are from 0.15 to 0.5\\
\subsection{Sludge Age}\index{Sludge Age}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sludge age is the average time (days) that a sludge particle (cell) spends in the system.  \item Sludge age dictates the presence and predominance of the different types of organisms and is measured as Mean Cell Retention Time (MCRT) or Solids Retention Time (SRT).\\
\item Sludge age is the average time that a sludge particle (cell) spends in the system
\item Conventional AS process - MCRTs are in the range of 5 to 15 days
\item The desired MCRT for a given plant must be found experimentally
\item \hl{F:M and MCRT are inversely related: that is a long MCRT means a low F:M and a short MCRT means a high F:M} 
\item Both, F:M and MCRT values vary from plant to plant and are established through a trial and error process.
\item The MCRT is calculated as:\\ 
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2cm}
$MCRT(days) = $\\
$\dfrac{Total \enspace MLSS \enspace lbs \enspace in \enspace the \enspace aeration \enspace system \enspace (aeration \enspace tank \enspace + \enspace clarifier)}{Total \enspace amount \enspace in \enspace lbs/day \enspace of \enspace suspended \enspace solids \enspace leaving  \enspace the \enspace system \enspace(Effluent\enspace SS+ WAS \enspace solids)}$\\
\vspace{0.4cm} 
$MCRT (days) = \dfrac{MLSS \enspace in \enspace aeration \enspace tank \enspace (lbs)+MLSS \enspace in \enspace clarifier \enspace (lbs)}{Effluent \enspace suspended \enspace solids \enspace (lbs/day)+\enspace WAS \enspace SS \enspace (lbs/day)}$\\
\vspace{5mm}
\section{Sludge Settleability}\index{Sludge Settleability}

\begin{itemize}
\item A settleability test is conducted on the mixed liquor from the aeration reactor to  measure the compaction and settleability characteristics of the secondary solids.
\item In the settleability test, a 1-liter mixed liquor sample is allowed to settle for 30-minutes in a graduated cylinder $-$ settleometer. 
\item The \textbf{Sludge Volume Index (SVI)} of the sludge is calculated using results from the 30-minute settleability test and the MLSS value.
\item SVI is expressed in ml/g and it is essentially the volume (ml) of 1 gram of the MLSS after 30 minutes of settling.
\item SVI (ml/g)= $\dfrac{Settled \enspace sludge \enspace volume \enspace in \enspace ml/l \enspace after \enspace 30 \enspace min}{MLSS \enspace mg/l}*1000 \dfrac{mg}{g}$
\item SVI provides a more accurate picture of the sludge settling characteristics than settleability or MLSS alone.
\item 50 to 120 ml/g SVI value is considered optimal.
\item Higher SVI values  indicate sludge that is slow to settle and not compacting well.
\item When SVI values are approaching 200 ml/g, activated sludge process is considered to be "bulking".
\item Regular monitoring of SVI help identify changes occurring in the activated sludge process preventing settling problems before they occur.
\item Like F:M and MCRT, the optimal SVI value for each plant varies and is also established by trial and error.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}

\section{RAS and WAS Pumping Rates}\index{RAS and WAS Pumping Rates}

The RAS and WAS pumping rates are primarily to control the amount of microbes in the aeration basin and the sludge age.  RAS and WAS adjustments may be necessary to prevent solids build-up in the clarifier which may lead to solids overflowing  with the effluent. Typical RAS flow rates range from 30-100\% of the influent flow rate.

\section{Activated Sludge Microbiology}\index{Activated Sludge Microbiology}

\begin{itemize}
\item In order for it to be effective, the activated sludge process has to sustain complex set of microorganisms which not only effectively remove the organic material from the wastewater in the aeration tank but also settle and compact well in the clarifier to produce a high quality sludge with a low BOD wastewater effluent.
\item Regular microscopic examination of the activated sludge is conducted to assess the composition of the microbial population and diagnose any potential or occurring process issues.  \item As the normal aerobic bacteria present is too small to observe easily, it is the higher microbial forms - mainly the protozoans and metazoans are observed.
\item The floc in an activated sludge has a porous structure and is essentially an aggregate of bacteria and extracelular material including organic polymers - polysaccharides and other substances secreted by the microorganisms, and remnants of dead microorganisms.
\item Typically, the trophic organisms such as the protozoas and rotifers which feed on the bacteria and other particulates are generally present on the outer surface of the flocs.
\item MCRT is the key factor which establishes the organism mix in the activated sludge.  As MCRT increases, the size and complexity of the organisms increases. 
\item The types of organisms predominating in the Mixed Liquor give an indication as to the age of the sludge.
\end{itemize}


\section{Process Issues}\index{Process Issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item Straggler floc:  This condition shows small, light, and fluffy floc particles with poor settling characteristics. It occurs due to young sludge or low MCRT/MLSS levels and may be related to an inadequate microorganism population or an excessive BOD load (high F:M) which causes a log growth situation. The cells become dispersed rather than flocculated, settleability is poor, and the effluent becomes turbid. In this condition oxygen is used up quickly due to the high metabolism rate, and sludge production is high. One tell-tale sign of this condition is the production of huge amounts of a billowing white foam.

\item Pin floc:  Pin floc are larger dimension spherical particles.  When pin floc is present, the sludge settles well in the settleability test but the supernatant is cloudy. This floc consist mostly of floc-forming bacteria without a filament backbone.  This condition occurs at starvation condition when all of the influent BOD has been used up (low F:M) and the old sludge age organisms are now in endogenous respiration.

\item Rising sludge: Under this condition, sludge settles well, compacts on the bottom of the clarifier, then starts to rise in clumps and patches to the surface.  Rising sludge is typically evidenced as brown in color.  Rising sludge occurs due to either denitrification or sludge septicity due to an excessive detention time in the clarifier.  

\item Bulking and Foaming:  Typical bacteria present in activated sludge include spherical, rod shaped and filamentous.  The presence of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge provide the important structural element for the bacterial floc.  However, presence of excessive filametous bacteria results in bulking or foaming.  Bulking is is marked by poor compaction – high SVI - SVI values near or above 200 ml/g.
\item Identifying which filaments are dominating in the system through a microscopic evaluation will help the operator to understand the condition in the treatment system so that corrective changes can be made.\\

\subsection{Mean Cell Residence Time}\index{Mean Cell Residence Time}


The MCRT is calculated as:\\  
\vspace{0.2cm}
$MCRT(days) = $\\
$\dfrac{Total \enspace MLSS \enspace lbs \enspace in \enspace the \enspace aeration \enspace system \enspace (aeration \enspace tank \enspace + \enspace clarifier)}{Total \enspace amount \enspace in \enspace lbs/day \enspace of \enspace suspended \enspace solids \enspace leaving  \enspace the \enspace system \enspace(Effluent\enspace SS+ WAS \enspace solids)}$\\
\vspace{0.4cm} 
$MCRT (days) = \dfrac{MLSS \enspace in \enspace aeration \enspace tank \enspace (lbs)+MLSS \enspace in \enspace clarifier \enspace (lbs)}{Effluent \enspace suspended \enspace solids \enspace (lbs/day)+\enspace WAS \enspace SS \enspace (lbs/day)}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Key Points for Solving MCRT Problems}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{MLSS quantification}:\\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item Pounds formula is used to calculate lbs MLSS using: i) aeration tank and the clarifier volumes, and ii) the given MLSS concentration.  
\item The MLSS concentrations for the aeration tank and the clarifier are the same.  So the given MLSS concentration applies to both - the aeration tank and the clarifier
\item Make sure it is the MLSS concentration that you are using not the MLVSS concentration.  
\item If MLSS concentration is not given but instead MLVSS concentration is given, you will need to find the MLSS concentration by dividing the MLVSS conc. by the mixed liquor volatile solids, as MLVSS(conc.) = MLSS * \% volatile solids
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Suspended solids quantification}:\\ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Effluent suspended solids}
\begin{itemize}
\item Effluent suspended solids can be quantified using the pounds formula - using the effluent flow (in MGD) and the effluent suspended solids concentration.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{WAS suspended solids}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use pounds formula given the WAS flow (make sure it is in MG) and the WAS SS concentration
\item Note that the WAS and RAS streams have the same SS concentration.  If WAS SS concentration is not specified, use the RAS SS concentration
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} 

\hl{Example Problems:}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item In an conventional activated sludge plant  the aeration tank contains 6000 lbs of MLSS and the final clarifier contains 2300 lbs of MLSS. 1450 lbs of solids are wasted each day and 90 lbs/day of solids leave in the final effluent. Calculate the MCRT for this plant.\\
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm} 
$MCRT (days) =  \dfrac{MLSS \enspace in \enspace aeration \enspace tank \enspace (lbs)+MLSS \enspace in \enspace clarifier \enspace (lbs)}{SS \enspace effluent \enspace (lbs/day)+SS \enspace WAS \enspace (lbs/day)}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm} 
$MCRT (days) =  \dfrac{6000lbs \enspace + \enspace 2300 lbs}{90lbs/day\enspace + \enspace 1450 lbs/day}=5.4=\boxed{5days}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
\item A activated sludge plant treats an average influent flow of 4 MGD.  The plant has two  aeration tanks – 0.45 MG volume each and two final clarifiers – 0.2 MG volume each, and a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration averages  1800 mg/l.   The effluent suspended solids concentration averages 18 mg/L. The WAS flow is 100,000 gallons per day has a SS concentration of 6100 mg/L. Calculate the MCRT\\
Solution:\\
$MCRT (days) =  \dfrac{MLSS \enspace in \enspace aeration \enspace tank \enspace (lbs)+MLSS \enspace in \enspace clarifier \enspace (lbs)}{SS \enspace effluent \enspace (lbs/day)+SS \enspace WAS \enspace (lbs/day)}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
$MLSS \enspace in \enspace aeration \enspace tank \enspace (lbs)=2*0.45*1800*8.34=13511lbs$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
$MLSS \enspace in \enspace clarifier \enspace (lbs)=2*0.2*1800*8.34=6005lbs$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
$SS \enspace effluent \enspace (lbs/day)=4MGD *18mg/l*8.34=600lbs/day$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
$SS \enspace WAS \enspace (lbs/day)=\dfrac{100000}{1000000}MGD *4800mg/l*8.34=4003lbs/day$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
Plugging in the values calculated above: $MCRT (days) =  \dfrac{13511+6005}{600+4003}=4.2=\boxed{4days}$\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{F:M (Food to Microorganism Ratio}\index{F:M (Food to Microorganism Ratio}

\begin{itemize}
\item This parameter ratios the food – the mass of primary effluent BOD entering the aeration basin to the mass of the microorganisms - \textbf{MLVSS}, in the aeration basin.
\item \textbf{Only the mass of the microorganisms (MLVSS) in the aeration basin is used – the mass of microorganisms in the secondary clarifier is not considered}
\item Common ranges for F/M for a conventional activated sludge plant are from 0.15 to 0.5. 
\item The optimum F/M varies from plant to plant and can be determined by trial and error.
\item The F:M may be used to determine the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids to be maintained in the aeration tank.
\item Generally, low F/M ratios should be carried during the colder months as the microorganism activity (metabolism) is lower.
\item F:M and MCRT are inversely related: that is a long MCRT means a low F:M and a short MCRT means a high F:M
\end{itemize}
F:M=$\dfrac{amount \enspace of \enspace food \enspace coming \enspace in}{amount \enspace of \enspace microorganisms \enspace present}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\hspace{0.7cm}$=\dfrac{(lbs/day) \enspace primary \enspace effluent  \enspace BOD \enspace entering \enspace the  \enspace aeration \enspace tank}{(lbs) \enspace MLVSS \enspace in \enspace the  \enspace aeration \enspace tank}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Key Points for Solving F:M Problem}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Quantifying F:}
\begin{itemize}
\item use the pounds formula to calculate the lbs/day of BOD in the primary effluent.\\
lbs/day BOD = Primary eff. flow (MGD)* Primary eff. BOD concentration (mg/l) * 8.34\\
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantifying M:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The concentration of the microorganisms is assumed to be the same as the MLVSS concentration
\item \textbf{Only the mass of the microorganisms (MLVSS) in the aeration basin is used – the mass of microorganisms in the secondary clarifier is not considered} 
\item lbs MLVSS may be calculated using pounds formula using the volume of the aeration tank (in MG) and the MLVSS concentration
\item If the MLVSS concentration is not given, it can be calculated from the MLSS and MLSS \% volatile matter (solids) concentration\\
MLVSS = MLSS * \% MLSS volatile solids
\end{itemize}


\hl{Example Problem:}\\
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item A conventional activated sludge plant receives an average flow of 5.5 MGD. The influent BOD to the plant averages 230mg/l and the primary effluent BOD average 160 mg/l. The 1 MG aeration tank has an MLSS concentration of 2800 mg/L and the MLVSS volatile solids content is 75\%. Calculated the F:M ratio for this plant.
\vspace{0.3cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
F=5.5*160*8.34=7339lbs/day BOD\\
M=1*2800*0.75*8.34=17514lbs MLVSS\\
F:M=$\dfrac{7339}{17514}=\boxed{0.41}$\\

Note:  The 160 mg/l BOD concentration of the primary effluent was used for the F calculation and not 230mg/l - which is the BOD concentration of the flow coming into the plant\\
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Sludge Volume Index (SVI)}\index{Sludge Volume Index (SVI)}

\begin{itemize}
\item SVI measures the settleability and compactibility of the secondary sludge
\item It is calculated using results from the 30-minute settleability test and the MLSS concentration
\item SVI is expressed in ml/g and it is essentially the volume (ml) of 1 gram of the MLSS after 30 minutes of settling
\item it provides a more accurate picture of the sludge settling characteristics than settleability or MLSS alone
\item 50 to 120 ml/gm SVI value is considered
optimal. Higher SVI values indicate sludge that is slow to settle and not compacting well. When SVI
values are approaching 200 ml/gm, activated sludge process is considered to be "bulking".
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
SVI (ml/g)= $\dfrac{Settled \enspace sludge \enspace volume \enspace in \enspace ml/l \enspace after \enspace 30 \enspace min}{MLSS \enspace mg/l}*1000 \dfrac{mg}{g}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Key Points for Solving SVI Problems}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item For the settling test MLSS is typically settled in a 1 liter settleometer.  The volume of the settled solids is therefore read as ml/L.  So if for any reason a larger or smaller volume of the mixed liquor sample is taken, the settle solids value should commensurate with the volume of the MLSS sample.  For example, if a 2 liter settleometer is used and if the solids settle to 400 ml in that settleometer, the ml/L will be 400ml/2L or 200ml/L
\item For some problems, the settled solids volume is provided as a percentage (\%).  So if a 1-liter settlometer is used and the settled solids volume is reported as 25\%, it implies a settled sludge volume of 250ml/L
\end{itemize} 
\hl{Example Problem:}\\
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item In an aeration tank, the MLSS is 2500 mg/l and recorded 30-minute settling test indicates 230 ml/L.  What is the sludge volume index?\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
Solution:\\
SVI=$\dfrac{230ml/l}{2500mg/l}*1000\dfrac{mg}{g}=\boxed{92ml/g}$
\end{enumerate}
