\section{Importance of Digestion}\index{Importance of Digestion}

		\begin{itemize}
		\item Solids (sludge) generated from the wastewater treatment processes contain organic compounds and also constituents that are beneficial plant nutrients. 
		\item However, the organic solids present in the sludge include pathogens and are also not stable (will putrefy)
		\item Thus, prior to the beneficial reuse of wastewater sludge or its disposal, sludge must be treated – stabilized to prevent odors and protect public health
		\item Additionally, if sludge is stabilized using anaerobic digestion, it  allows for the conversion of organic solids to yield valuable energy source - digester gas
		\end{itemize}
Sludge stabilization process results in the following:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Reduction in amount of solids - reducing biosolids hauling costs
		\item Pathogen reduction
		\item Odor reduction
		\item Reduction in vector attraction
		\item Product with beneficial reuse
		\end{enumerate}

Most common processes involved in sludge stabilization include:

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Digestion - Aerobic or anaerobic
		\item Lime or alkaline stabilization
		\item Composting
		\item Long term storage in lagoons
		\item Thermal processes
		\item Incineration
		\end{enumerate}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \hl{Sludge digestion is a microbiological process and is the most common sludge stabilization method}.
		\item There are two major sludge digestion processes:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item aerobic digestion which utilizes aerobic microorganisms, and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct
			\item anaerobic digestion which utilizes anaerobic microorganisms and it produces digester gas as a byproduct.
			\item Digester gas is typically composed of 60-65\% methane gas with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and is useful because of its potential use as fuel - energy recovery from wastewater.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

\section{Anaerobic Digestion Process Basics}\index{Anaerobic Digestion Process Basics}

		\begin{itemize}
		\item Solids removed from the primary and secondary treatment processes is fed to the digesters.  
		\item The sludge feed to the digesters range between 3 – 6\% total solids which typically contain 70\% organic solids
		\item The anaerobic digester is typically a large cylindrical concrete tank and is operated as a continuous process at a fixed volume\\ $\implies$ as sludge is fed into the digester it displaces an equal amount of sludge which leaves the digester.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{DigesterFixedCover}\\
\textbf{Anaerobic Digester}\\
\end{center}
		\item The sludge typically occupies 70 - 90\% of the total digester volume and the methane carbon dioxide gas mixture occupies the headspace from where it is withdrawn also on a continuous basis.
		\item In the anaerobic digestion process microorganisms convert volatile matter into mainly methane (CH$_4$) and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$)
		\item The sludge content of the digesters is kept mixed and maintained in a constant temperature range using external heating.
		\item The activity and type of bacteria present in the digester is dictated by the operating temperature of the digester.
		\item Anaerobic digestion can be in the following three temperature ranges, each of which has its own unique microbiology.\\
			\begin{enumerate}[1. ]
			\item Psychrophilic digester:  Digester is maintained between 50  - 65 F.  Sludge detention time - 50 to 180 days
			\item Mesophilic digesters: – Digester is most commonly operated  between 95 – 98 F and the typical number of days required for digestion is between 15 to 30 days.\\
			\item Thermophilic digesters:  These digesters’ optimal operating temperatures range is between 113   135 F and it typically requires 5 to 12 days.\\
			\end{enumerate}     
		\item These organic solids are measured as volatile solids (VS).  
		\item The volatile solids content of the sludge entering and leaving the digester are measured to quantify the solids removal in the digester
		 \item Breakdown of volatile matter in the sludge ultimately into methane (CH$_4$) and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) occurs in multiple steps involving different groups of microorganisms as follows:\\
			\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
			\item Hydrolysis:  Here the microorganisms breakdown complex organic matter in the sludge - carbohydrates, proteins, lignin, and lipids into simpler compounds including sugars, soluble fatty acids and amines.\\
			\item Acid Formation:  The simpler compounds formed in Step 1 are converted to organic acids by acid forming bacteria\\
			\item Methane Formation: The organic acids formed in Step 2 are converted into methane and carbon dioxide by methane forming bacteria.\\
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Gas production ranges between 10 to 16 cubic feet per pound of volatile matter destroyed and the gas production remains stable over time.
		\item Low gas production indicates problems - toxicity, temperature, volatile acid to alkalinity ratio, mixing, or feed rates.
		\end{itemize}

					Applying this equation to calculate the digester VS reduction if the inlet sludge VS averages 75\% and the outlet sludge is 58\%?\\

\chapter{Chlorination}


\begin{itemize}
\item Treated wastewater effluent is disinfected prior to its discharge into a water body inorder to destroy pathogens primarily to prevent spread of waterborne disease and minimize public health problems
\item Chlorine is a very effective disinfectant and is the most widely used disinfectant for wastewater 
\item Chlorine disinfection is a practical and economical means for disinfecting large quantities of wastewaters which have been treated to various degrees. 
\item However, due to its toxicity, associated risk factors and its rising cost, use of ultraviolet light and ozone for wastewater disinfection is on the rise
\end{itemize}


\section{Forms of Chlorine}\index{Forms of Chlorine}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Due to safety issues related to the use of chlorine gas, 			\textbf{hypochlorites} are often used in lieu of chlorine
	\item Types of hypochlorites
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) comes in a liquid form which contains up to 12.5\% chlorine
	\item Calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl)$_2$), also known as HTH, is a solid which is mixed with water to form a hypochlorite solution. Calcium hypochlorite is 65-70\% concentrated.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Hypochlorites decompose in strength over time while in storage. Temperature, light, and physical energy can all break down hypochlorites before they are able to react with pathogens in water. 

\end{itemize} 

\section{Chlorine Properties}\index{Chlorine Properties}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chlorine is a yellowish-green gas at room temperature and atmosphric pressure
\item Chlorine gas can be pressurized and cooled to its liquid form for making it easy to ship and store. 
\item When liquid chlorine is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground (being heavier than air) and spreads rapidly.
	\item 	While it is not explosive or flammable, as a liquid or gas it can react violently with many substances 
	\item Chlorine is only slightly soluble in water (0.3 to 0.7\% by weight.) 
	\item Chlorine gas has a greenish-yellow color 
	\item It has a characteristic disagreeable and pungent odor, similar to chlorine-based laundry bleaches, and is detectable by smell at concentrations as low as 0.2 to 0.4 ppm
	\item It is about two and a half times as heavy as air
	\item One volume of liquid chlorine yields about 460 volumes of chlorine gas. 
	\item Liquid chlorine is amber in color and is about one and a half times as heavy as water 
	\item Chlorine is an irritant to the eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and the respiratory system 
\end{itemize}


\section{Chlorine Storage and Safety}\index{Chlorine Storage and Safety}


\subsection{Chlorine Delivery}\index{Chlorine Delivery}

\begin{itemize}
\item Typically for smaller plants chlorine gas is shipped in  pressurized steel cylinders - 150 lb or 2000 lb (ton cylinder) size
\item Larger plants may get their chlorine supply in rail tank cars
\item The daily chlorine usage is typically established based upon the weighing of the chlorine containers.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Chlorine Leak Response}\index{Chlorine Leak Response}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typically for smaller plants chlorine gas is shipped in  pressurized steel cylinders - 150 lb or 2000 lb (ton cylinder) size.  Larger plants may get their chlorine supply in rail tank cars.  
	\item The daily chlorine usage is typically established based upon the weighing of the chlorine containers.
	\item The withdrawal rates from a chlorine cylinder is based on the temperature of the liquid in the cylinder, and thus the pressure of the gas. 
	\item As chlorine gas is withdrawn from the cylinder, it absorbs the heat from the surroundings.
	\item For low withdrawal rates, heat will be able to be transferred from the surrounding air to the container in time so that there is no drop in temperature or pressure, 
	\item If the chlorine withdrawal is larger, the air will not be able to transfer the heat quickly enough and the temperature (and pressure) of the chlorine will drop, thus resulting in a lower feed rate. 
	\item If high enough and prolonged enough, this can even result in ice formation around the outside of the container, further decreasing the withdrawal rate. 
	\item The most effective way to increase withdrawal rate from a single container is to circulate the surrounding air with a fan. Again, never apply heat to the containers.
	\item If chlorine gas escapes from a container or system, being heavier than air, it will seek the lowest level in the building or area
	\item Only trained staff with access to proper personal protection equipment (PPE) including self-contained breathing apparatus, should handle the chlorine cylinders and address chlorine leak issues 
	\item When a leak is suspected, it is recommended that ammonia vapors be used to find the source. When ammonia vapor using a rag or brush, is directed at a leak, a white cloud will form. To produce ammonia vapor, a plastic squeeze bottle containing about 5 \% ammonia, aqua ammonia (ammonium hydroxide solution) should be used. A weaker solution such as household ammonia may not be concentrated enough to detect minor leaks
	\item All safety equipment should be located outside of the chlorine room and be easily accessed by all personnel
	\item Small leaks around valve stems can usually be corrected by tightening the packing nut or closing the valve. A leak can also be reduced by removing the chlorine as rapidly as possible
	\item If it cannot be added to the process there are several chemicals which can be used to absorb the chlorine gas. For example, chlorine can be absorbed by using 1$frac{1}{4}$ pounds of caustic soda or hydrated line, or 3 pounds of soda ash per pound of chlorine. 
	\item If the leaking container can be moved, it should be transported to an outdoors area where minimal harm will occur. Keep the leaking part the most elevated so that gaseous chlorine will leak rather than liquid chlorine.
	\item If the leak is large, all persons in the adjacent area must be warned and evacuated. Only authorized persons equipped with the proper breathing apparatus, and protective measures to the eyes and body should investigate. 
	\item As water is not an efficient absorbent for chlorine and the fact that chlorine reacts with water to form very corrosive hydrochloric acid, never apply water to a leak or consider submerging a chlorine cylinder (for example, in a pond or tank), since it will probably float.
	\item Remember to keep windward of the leak.
	\item As chlorine cylinders pressure increases with temperature, as a safety measure the chlorine cylinders are fitted with fusible plug which melts between 158$^o$ and 165$^o$ F.
	\item Keep chlorine cylinder or container emergency repair kits available. Be familiar with their use and location.
	\item Leaks at fusible plugs and cylinder valves requires special handling and emergency equipment. The chlorine supplier must be notified immediately
	\item Pin hole leaks in cylinder walls or ton tanks can usually be stopped by mechanical pressure applications (clamps, turnbuckles, etc.). This only temporary and may require your ingenuity.
	\item Leaking containers cannot be shipped.
	\item In general, daily inspection of all chlorine cylinders will avoid major problems
\end{itemize}

hypochlorous acid  \hspace{1.9 cm}      hydrogen ion   \hspace{1.5cm}           hypochlorite ion

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Hypochlorous acid is the most effective form of chlorine available to kill microorganisms
			\item Hypochlorite ions is much less efficient disinfectant
		\end{itemize}

		\item The concentration of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions in chlorinated water will depend on the water's pH
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A higher pH facilitates the formation of more hypochlorite ions and results in less hypochlorous acid in the water
		\end{itemize}
		\item A significant percentage of the chlorine is still in the form of hypochlorous acid even between pH 8 and pH 9
		\end{itemize}



\section{Chlorine Disinfection}\index{Chlorine Disinfection}

\begin{itemize}
\item When chlorine is added to a wastewater flow, it will first react or combine with certain organic and inorganic substances present, prior to acting on pathogens.  The amount of chlorine used up as part of these reactions is referred to as the \textbf{chlorine demand}\\

\item The \textbf{free chlorine} remaining after the chlorine demand is satisfied, is the strongest form of chlorine available for disinfection.  

\item Chlorine combined with ammonia (as chloramines) and organic compounds (as chloroorganic compounds), known as \textbf{combined chlorine} also exhibit disinfecting properties - albeit weaker than the free chlorine.

\item \text{Total residual chlorine} is the sum of free chlorine and combined chlorine and it is the residual chlorine concentration which represents the amount of chlorine available for disinfection 

\item \textbf{Chlorine Demand = Applied Chlorine Dose - Chlorine Residual}\\ Chlorine residual should be the basis of measuring the effectiveness of chlorine disinfection

\item Chlorine residuals are measured in the field using a colorimeteric method.  In the laboratory, chlorine residuals are measured typically using: 1) Amperometric Titration, or 2) Iodometric Titration

\item Chlorine dosage is typically established from either bench scale laboratory testing, or actual measurement of field results. 

\item Since field conditions, particularly the mixing element, are not as well controlled as laboratory tests, the actual dosage is expected to be generally higher than from that established in the laboratory. 

\item Even though residual chlorine concentration can be used for establishing the effectiveness of disinfection, the ultimate effectiveness of disinfection can be monitored by conducting bacteriological testing.

\end{itemize}

\section{Factors Affecting Chlorine Disinfection Efficiency}\index{Factors Affecting Chlorine Disinfection Efficiency}

The disinfection efficiency of chlorine depends on the following factors:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item pH:  Disinfection is more efficient at a low pH when large quantities of hypochlorous acid are present than at a high pH when hypochlorite ions is the dominant species in the water
	\item Concentration:  Contact Time Ratio (CT):  For effective chlorine disinfection both sufficient chlorine dosages – concentration (C) as well as contact time (T) are necessary.  There may be a substantial residual but if CT factor is not adequate, disinfection may not be effective. Generally both of these factors must be worked out experimentally for a given system
	\item Temperature:  Colder temperatures are less favorable for disinfection. 
Proper contacting or mixing or agitation:  This is necessary to make sure that the chlorine applied contacts or reaches the microbial cells
	\item Organic and inorganic material present:  The chlorine used by these organic and inorganic reducing substances including metal ions, organic matter and ammonia, is defined as the chlorine demand.  So that the amount of chlorine that has to be added to wastewater for different purposes will also vary.
\item Even though residual chlorine concentration can be used for establishing the effectiveness of disinfection, the ultimate effectiveness of disinfection can be monitored by conducting bacteriological testing.
\end{itemize}
		
\section{Dechlorination}\index{Dechlorination}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dechlorination is the process of removing residual chlorine from disinfected wastewater prior to discharge into the environment
\item Dehlorination is necessary to mitigate the toxic effect of chlorine on the receiving waters.  
\item Sulfur dioxide is most commonly used for dechlorination.
\item Other chemicals used for sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Establishing Chlorine Dosage}\index{Establishing Chlorine Dosage}

\hl{Example Problems:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate how many pounds per day of chlorine should be used to maintain a dosage of 12 mg/l at a 5.0 MGD flow.\\
Solution:\\
$lbs/day=conc. (mg/l)*flow(MGD)*8.34$\\
$lbs/day=12*5*8.34=\boxed{500.4lbs/day}$\\

\subsection{Calculating Dosage/Residual/Demand Concentrations}\index{Calculating Dosage/Residual/Demand Concentrations}

\hl{Example Problems:}
\item If 80 pounds of chlorine are applied each day to a flow of 1.5 MGD, what is the dosage in mg/l?\\
Solution:\\
Applying the pounds formula:\\  $lbs/day=conc. (mg/l)*flow(MGD)*8.34$\\
$\implies conc. (mg/l)=\dfrac{lbs/day}{flow(MGD)*8.34}=\dfrac{80}{1.5*8.34}=\boxed{6.4mg/l}$

\item How many pounds per day of chlorine will be required to disinfect a secondary effluent flow of 1.68 MGD if the chlorine demand is found to be 8.5 mg/l and a residual of 3 mg/l is desired?
Chlorine dosage = chlorine demand + chlorine residual\\
$chlorine \enspace dosage=8.5+3=11.5mg/l$\\
$lbs/day=conc. (mg/l)*flow(MGD)*8.34=1.68*11.5*8.34=\boxed{161.2lbs/day}$\\

8.	Ans.  112.6\\

\vspace{0.3cm}
Solution: \\
$ chlorine \enspace dosage = chlorine \enspace demand \enspace + \enspace chlorine \enspace residual$\\
$\implies chlorine \enspace dosage = (12.5 \enspace + \enspace 1 )mg/l=13.5 mg/l$\\
$lbs/day=13.5(mg/l)*1(MGD)*8.34=\boxed{112.6 lbs/day}$\\
