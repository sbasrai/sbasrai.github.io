\section{Definition of Wastewater}\index{Definition of Wastewater}


Wastewater is human-polluted water from home and industries. This includes water from:
\begin{itemize}
\item Flushing toilets and urinals  - blackwater.
\item Bathing, showering, and washing clothes and dishes  - greywater.
\item Commercial and industrial activities.
\item ...and often included is stormwater which contain pollutants washed off from inhabited areas - roads, parking lots, and rooftops.
\end{itemize}

\section{Why Treat Wastewater}\index{Why Treat Wastewater}
Although nature has an inherent capability to breakdown pollutants, given the large quantity generated from human activities, there is a need for centralized wastewater treatment plants to treat wastewater before releasing it back to the environment.  Wastewater from homes, businesses, and industries are collected in sewers for delivery to the treatment plant and subsequently discharged to a water body like a lake, river or ocean, or land, or reused. 

Wastewater treatment is designed to remove:
\begin{itemize}
\item organic matter
\item inorganic  pollutants including plant nutrients - nitrogen and phosphorous\\
\item pathogenic (disease causing) organisms\\
\end{itemize}

\section{Benefits of Treating Wastewater}\index{Benefits of Treating Wastewater}
Wastewater treatment protects:
\begin{itemize}
\item The environment
\item Human health
\end{itemize}

Specifically, wastewater treatment allows for the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mitigates deterioration of the receiving waters' ecosystem }\\
The discharge of inadequately treated wastewater will cause oxygen levels in the receiving waters to be depleted, due to:

\begin{itemize}

\item Wastewater containing nitrogen and phosphorus based pollutants (plant nutrients) entering a water body such as a lake or river will promote plant and algae growth which will seriously impact its normal aquatic life including fish through a process similar to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Nutrient promote algae bloom
\item Algae bloom prevent sunlight to the native plant spieces below the water's surface causing native plants to die
\item The organic material from the dead plants and algae promote growth of aerobic bacteria which will consume the dissolved oxygen in the water resulting in oxygen depletion.
\item The natural aquatic life including fish, frogs, and turtles will not be able to survive under oxygen depleted conditions and will die or leave that zone.
\end{itemize}
\item Other organic material present in wastewater will similarly promote growth of aerobic bacteria, intensifying the eutrophication of the receiving waters.
\end{itemize}

Thus, proper treatment of wastewater will prevent \hl{eutrophication} - which is the depletion of dissolved oxygen of the receiving water, consequently impacting/destroying its normal aquatic life.

\item \textbf{Removal of other harmful pollutants}\\
Organic and inorganic pollutants, including metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, chromium and arsenic can have acute and chronic toxic effects on aquatic species and wildlife including migratory birds, are removed during the wastewater treatment process.
\item \textbf{Removal of pathogens}\\
Wastewater treatment removes parasites and disease-causing pathogens including bacteria and viruses for:
\begin{itemize}
\item People to continue enjoying recreational activities in the receiving bodies of waters such as lakes and rivers
\item Preventing the contamination of fish and other consumable products obtained from the waters
\item Allow the water body to remain as the source of potable water
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Reclaim water for recycle or reuse}\\
Besides protecting human health and the environment, wastewater treatment paves way for establishing the reuse or recycle of treated wastewater.  This benefit is particularly important for densely populated areas with limited access to fresh water supplies.  
\end{enumerate}


\section{Regulations Related to Wastewater Treatment}\index{Regulations Related to Wastewater Treatment}
The main objective of these regulations is to ensure appropriate quality of the treated wastewater.  

\subsection{Treated Wastewater - NPDES Permit}\index{Treated Wastewater - NPDES Permit}
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the United States.

\begin{itemize}
\item The NPDES permit program was created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act (CWA)and is administered by the federal USEPA.
\item Applies to sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the United States.
\item Requires all facilities discharging “pollutants” into any body of water in the USA to obtain and comply with a \hl{NPDES permit}.
\item NPDES permit \hl{establishes} \textul{discharge limits}, \textul{monitoring} and \textul{reporting} \hl{requirements}\\
\item In California, the responsibility of implementing the federal NPDES program is delegated to the State of California through the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board or SWRCB) and finally to the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards or RWQCB), collectively known as Water Boards. 
\item The RWQCB issues the NPDES permit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Influent Wastewater - National Pretreatment Program}\index{Influent Wastewater - National Pretreatment Program}
Municipal wastewater treatment plants also known as Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) implement and enforce their Pretreatment or Industrial Discharge Control programs to meet Federal and State regulations requirements related to wastewater discharges from industrial sources.  The national pretreatment program is a component of the NPDES program and is also known as the Source Control Program\\

The Pretreatment/Source Control program is for controlling industrial (non-domestic) wastewater discharges with the following objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Protect the treatment plant operations so that the industrial discharge does not contain pollutants or have certain characteristics (including pH, temperature) which could adversely effect the treatment process or impact public safety and the safety of the people working at the treatment plant.
\item Prevent the introduction of pollutants that could pass through untreated and into the receiving body of water.

\item Improve opportunities for reuse or recycling of wastewater and sewage sludge.

\end{enumerate}

In California:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wastewater treatment plants are required to have a Pretreatment Program when their total design flows are greater than five million gallons per day (5 mgd). 
\item Facilities with smaller flows (5 mgd or less) may also be required to implement a Pretreatment Program if they receive industrial waste and pretreatment is warranted.
\item The Pretreatment Program for a wastewater treatment entity is reviewed and approved by the State and Regional Water Boards, and 
\item The Pretreatment Program's monitoring and reporting requirements are incorporated in the facility's NPDES permit.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sewage Sludge/Biosolids Regulations}\index{Sewage Sludge/Biosolids Regulations}
Sewage sludge or biosolids is a byproduct of wastewater treatment.  The biosolids produced are disposed or used using methods including land application, landfill and incineration.  Federal Regulation 40CFR Part 503 also known as Rule 503 establishes the standards for the use or disposal of wastewater biosolids - as stipulated under the Clean Water Act.  The facility's NPDES permit incorporates the applicable federal, state and local requirements as they apply to its biosolids.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Part 503 rule applies to any person who applies biosolids to the land or fires biosolids in a biosolids incinerator, and to the owner/operator of a surface disposal site, or to any person who is a preparer or generator of biosolids for use, incineration, or disposal.
				\item Part 503 standard includes:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item General requirements which establishes the purpose and applicability of the rule, the compliance period, and exclusions from the rule.
						\item Limits on heavy metals content
						\item Solids management practices related to use and disposal of wastewater biosolids
						\item Operational standards related to biosolids management, and
						\item Requirements for the frequency of monitoring, record-keeping, and reporting
					\end{enumerate}
			\end{itemize}
Part 503 requirements are factored in when establishing the heavy metals concentration limits for the Pretreatment or Industrial Control Program as a significant portion of the heavy metals in the influent wastewater are removed as part of the wastewater solids.

\section{Air Quality Regulations}\index{Air Quality Regulations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Air emissions from wastewater collections and treatment systems are subject to federal, state and local air quality related rules and regulations established to protect human health and comfort, and the environment.  
\item Typically, a local agency such as the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is designated to enact and enforce air quality rules and regulations, through its permitting process, applicable to all sources of air emissions including wastewater treatment plants.\\

\item Systems/processes subject to air quality regulations at air quality regulations include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fugitive emissions:  Foul air containing compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and organics, which escape from process tanks, pipes and associated structures such as manholes and wetwells, is potentially harmful for the affected public and also cause odors.  
\item Digester gas combustion:  Digester gas a product of wastewater solids treatment contains methane and is either combusted in power generation equipment or burned in flares.
\item Odor control systems:  These commonly used systems are for controlling emissions of regulated pollutants such as ammonia and to prevent odors associated with compounds such as hydrogen sulfide.
\end{itemize}
 
\item Related to its air pollutants emissions, wastewater treatment plants are required to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Obtain air quality related operating permits for equipment and processes which emit air pollutants and for its systems treating foul air.
\item Implement air emission pollutants control measures
\item Comply with record keeping and reporting requirements
\item Comply with air quality rules to prevent public nuisance and protect public health and safety
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Elements of Wastewater Treatment}\index{Elements of Wastewater Treatment}

Wastewater cycle is a part of the water cycle where the water consumed as part of the normal human and industrial activity is returned back to the environment after treatment.

Wastewater cycle comprises of the following sequential elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generation
\item Collection
\item Treatment
\item Disposal or reuse
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Generation}\index{Generation}

Wastewater originates from domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities. The characteristics of wastewater vary depending on the source. Types of wastewater include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Domestic Sewage:}  wastewater derived principally from dwellings, business buildings, institutions, and \\
\item \hl{Industrial Sewage:}  liquid waste from industrial processes\\
\end{itemize}
Typical per person generation of wastewater in the USA is about 70-100 gallons per day

\subsection{Collections}\index{Collections}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wastewater is collected from its point of origin - home, businesses, industries etc. and conveyed via sewer lines to a centralized wastewater treatment facility.  
\item When the rainwater drainage is made part of the sewer system, the system is termed as \hl{Combined System}.  
\item The system where the sewage is conveyed separately from the stormwater flows is termed as \hl{Separated System}.  
\item In the Separated System, the Sanitary Sewers convey the wastewater and the Stormwater Sewer conveys the storm water flows.  
\item For the Combined System, rainstorms pose the threat of overwhelming the sewers and the treatment plant
\end{itemize}  
\begin{center}

\end{center}
			\hspace{2.6cm} Separated System \hspace{3.2cm} \parbox{\textwidth}{Combined System}\\

\subsection{Treatment}\index{Treatment}
\subsubsection{Liquid Phase Treatment}\index{Liquid Phase Treatment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wastewater treatment can involve physical, chemical or biological processes or combinations of these processes depending on the required outflow standards. 
\item Wastewater treatment typically involves a series of steps with increasing level of treatment:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Preliminary}:  The preliminary process removes large/coarse solids which include rocks, tree branches, grit and other debris present in wastewater.
\item \hl{Primary}:  The primary process is also a physical process where the separable wastewater solids - solids that float and solids that can settle, are removed.  
\item \hl{Secondary}:  Secondary treatment is a biological treatment process where microorganisms consume the organic matter present in the wastewater. 
\item \hl{Tertiary or Advanced Treatment}:  The tertiary/advanced treatment processes improve the quality of treated water beyond the secondary treatment level.  This process may include nutrient removal and disinfection.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Treatment of Wastewater Solids}\index{Treatment of Wastewater Solids}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solids are a byproduct of wastewater treatment.  
\item Screenings and grit removed as part of the preliminary treatment is typically disposed in a landfill.
\item Sludge generated from the wastewater treatment processes -  settled solids and scum from primary and secondary treatment processes needs to be treated prior to disposal or reuse to comply with wastewater solids - biosolids regulations.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
Typical solids treatment is comprised of the following three sequential steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sludge thickening
\item Sludge stabilization
\item Sludge dewatering
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\subsubsection{Sludge Thickening}\index{Sludge thickening}
Sludge thickening improves performance of sludge stabilization process and provides capital and operational cost savings due to a lower volume of sludge
\subsubsection{Sludge Stabilization}\index{Sludge Stabilization}
Sludge stabilization process produces solids (biosolids) that meet Part 503 rule requirements. 
\subsubsection{Sludge Dewatering}\index{Sludge Dewatering}
Solids stabilized using digestion process has only a small percentage by weight of solids -less than 5\%.  It therefore becomes necessary to dewater the stabilized sludge prior to hauling off-site for final disposal. 
\vspace{0.5cm}
A generalized layout/process sequencing in a wastewater treatment plant is shown below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{TreatmentFlow}
\end{center}
Individual wastewater treatment processes involve different process options or sequences which are illustrated in the graphic below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{Treatment}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disposal or Reuse}\index{Disposal or Reuse}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wastewater treatment processes can be designed to \hl{dispose} the treated water where the water is reintroduced to the environment or for \hl{reuse} where the treated water is \hl{reclaimed} or \hl{recycled} - for various purposes including irrigation, industrial use or for potable use.
\item Water disposal methods include:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Surface water discharge}
\item \hl{Subsurface discharge}
\end{itemize}
\item Water reuse methods include:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Potable water reuse
\begin{itemize}
\item \hl{Indirect potable reuse:}  Here the treated water is blended with groundwater or surface water and then reclaimed and treated further 
for drinking (potable) water use
\item \hl{Direct potable reuse:}  Here the treated wastewater is subjected to advanced treatment and introduced directly into a municipal water supply system
\end{itemize}
\item Water reclamation for irrigation or industrial use\\
\item Land application for beneficial use\\
\end{itemize}
\item Solids generated from the wastewater treatment process may be removed and disposed to a landfill or subject to further treatment which may allow for energy recovery - from the organic solids and for beneficial reuse due to its plant nutrient content.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit Conversions}\index{Unit Conversions}
For converting one measurement unit to another.

Step 1:  \texthl{Make sure the original unit is for the same measurement as the converted (desired) unit.}  So if the original unit is for area, say in ft$^2$ the converted unit should be another area unit such as in$^2$ or acre but it cannot be gallons as gallon is a unit of volume.

Step 2: Write down the conversion formula as:

$Quantity \enspace in \enspace converted \enspace unit = Quantity \enspace (\cancel{Original \enspace Unit}) *   Conversion  \enspace Factor \enspace  \dfrac{Conversion \enspace unit}{\cancel{Original \enspace unit}}$


\begin{table}[h!]

    \end{tabular}
 \caption{Common units in wastewater calculations}	
    \end{center}

    \end{table}



\subsection{Example Problems}
Problem 1\\
Convert 1000 $ft^3$ to cu. yards\\

$1000 \cancel{ft^3}*\dfrac{cu.yards}{27\cancel{ft^3}} = 37 cu.yards$

Problem 2\\
Convert 10 gallons/min to $ft^3$/hr\\

$\dfrac{10 \cancel{gallons}}{\cancel{min}}*  \dfrac{ft^3}{7.48 \cancel{gallons}}  * \dfrac{60 \cancel{min}}{hr}   = \dfrac{80.2ft^3}{hr}$


Problem 3\\
Convert 100,000 $ft^3$ to acre-ft.\\
$100,000 \cancel{ft^3} * \dfrac{acre-ft}{43,560 \cancel{ft^2-ft}} =  2.3 acre-ft$\\
\textbf{Note:} From the conversion table: acre = 43,560 $ft^2$\\
Thus, acre-ft  = 43,560 $ft^2$-ft\\

\subsection{Pounds Formula}\index{Pounds Formula}
%\section{Pounds Formula}\index{Pounds Formula}

% \begin{snugshade*}
% \item \noindent\textsc{Pounds Formula}
% \end{snugshade*}
Pounds formula is used for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculating the quantity in pounds of a particular wastewater constituent entering or leaving a wastewater treatment process
\item Calculating the pounds of chemicals to be added\\
\end{itemize}
So if the concentration of a particular constituent (in mg/liter) and the volume or flow of wastewater is given, one can calculate the amount of that constituent in pounds using the following – Pounds Formula:
$$lbs \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace \dfrac{lbs}{day}=Concentration\Big(\frac{mg}{l}\Big)*8.34*volume(MG) \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace Flow (MGD)$$\\

The Davidson Pie as shown below provides a pictorial representation of the Pounds Formula.

	\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{PoundsFormula}
\end{center}
\caption{Davidson Pie}
\end{figure}

In the Pounds Formula, there are three variables – lbs, concentration and volume, and one constant - 8.34.  Knowing any of the two variables in the formula, one can calculate the third (unknown) variable by rearranging the equation.\\

\vspace{0.3cm}
Davidson Pie provides a pictorial reference for calculating any unknown variable.  If for example, if Concentration is unknown, it can be calculated as follows: \\$$Concentration\Big(\frac{mg}{l}\Big)=\dfrac{lbs \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace \dfrac{lbs}{day}}{8.34*Volume(MG) \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace Flow (MGD)}$$\\

\vspace{0.3cm}

Likewise, if Volume (or Flow) is the unknown variable. it can be calculated as:  \\$$Volume (MG) \enspace or \enspace Flow(MGD)=\dfrac{lbs \enspace \textbf{or} \enspace \dfrac{lbs}{day}}{Concentration\Big(\dfrac{mg}{l}\Big)* \enspace 8.34  }$$

\subsection{Concentration}\index{Concentration}

Concentration is typically expressed as mg/l which is the weight of the constituent (mg) in 1 l (liter) of solution (wastewater).  As 1 l of water weighs 1 million mg, a concentration of 1 mg/l implies 1 mg of constituent per 1 million mg of water or one part per million (ppm).   \textbf{Thus, mg/l and ppm are synonymous.}\\  
Sometimes the constituent concentration is expressed in terms of percentage.\\
\vspace{6pt}
For example:  sludge containing 5\% solids or a 12.5\% chlorine concentration solution.\\
\vspace{6pt}
As one liter of water weighs 1,000,000 mg, one percent of that weight is 10,000 mg.  So 1\% solids implies 10,000 mg of solids per liter or 10,000 mg/l or 10,000 ppm.\\
\vspace{6pt}
$1\% \enspace concentration = 10,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace\dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$0.1\% \enspace concentration = 1,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$0.01\% \enspace concentration = 100 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$10\% \enspace concentration = 100,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$5\% \enspace concentration = 50,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
$12.5\% \enspace concentration = 125,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\

\subsubsection{Example Problems}
% \hl{Example Problems}\\

Problem 1\\Calculate the lbs/day of solids entering the plant given the influent flow is 5 MGD with an average solids concentration  of 250 mg/l.\\

Solution\\

Applying lbs formula:\\
$\dfrac{lbs}{day}=5 MGD *250\dfrac{mg}{l}*8.34 = \boxed{10,425\dfrac{lbs}{day}}$
\\
\vspace{6pt}
Problem 2\\Calculate the lbs of solids in the primary sludge if the sludge flow is 7500 gallons and the solids concentration is 4.5\%.\\
Solution\\
Applying lbs formula:\\
$lbs \enspace solids = \dfrac{7500}{1,000,000}MG * 4.5*10,000 *8.34 = \boxed{2,815 \enspace lbs \enspace solids}$\\
\textbf{Note:}\\  
1) 7500 gallons was converted to MG by dividing by 1,000,000\\
$7500 \enspace gallons * \dfrac{1 MG}{1,000,000 \enspace gallon}$\\
2) 4.5\% was converted to mg/l by multiplying by 10,000 as 1\%=10,000mg/l

% 	\item \noindent\textsc{Process Removal Efficiency}
% \end{snugshade*}
\begin{itemize}
\item Process removal rate or removal efficiency is the percentage of the inlet concentration removed.  
\item It is used for quantifying the pollutant removal during wastewater treatment and is established based upon the amount of a particular wastewater constituent entering and leaving a treatment process.

\item $Process \enspace Removal \enspace Rate \enspace (\%) = \dfrac{Pollutant \enspace  In-Pollutant\enspace  Out}{Pollutant \enspace In}*100$\\

\item If 10 units of a pollutant are entering a process and 8 units of pollutant are leaving (process removes 2 units), then the process removal rate for that pollutant is (10-8)/10*100=20\%.  In this example the process is 20\% efficient in removing that particular pollutant.

\item The amount of pollutant can be measured in terms of concentration (mg/l) or in terms of mass loading (lbs).  The pounds formula is used for calculating the mass loadings.  
\end{itemize}
The above example is for calculating the removal efficiency using the inlet and outlet concentrations or mass loading.\\
The methods below can be used for calculating either the inlet or outlet pollutant concentrations, if the removal efficiency and the corresponding inlet or outlet concentrations are given.

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
Using the fact that if the inlet concentration was 100 mg/l, the outlet concentration would be 100 minus the removal efficiency.\\
Setup the equation as:  $\dfrac{Out}{In}: \enspace \dfrac{X \enspace mg/l}{A \enspace mg/l}=\dfrac{100-RE\%}{100}$\\
Calculate X using cross multiplication - if $\dfrac{A}{B}=\dfrac{C}{D} \implies A=B*\dfrac{C}{D}$:\\
$X \enspace mg/l=A \enspace mg/l*\dfrac{100-RE\%}{100}$\\

$\implies Actual \enspace  Outlet (X) = 0.4 * 80 = \boxed{32 mg/l}$\\

$\implies 0.0975X=20 \implies X=\dfrac{20}{0.0975}=\boxed{205\dfrac{mg}{l}}$\\

Primary Effluent BOD = Influent BOD * (1-Primary BOD Removal), and\\
Secondary Effluent BOD=[Primary Effluent BOD]*(1-Secondary BOD Removal)\\
Secondary Eff. BOD=[Influent BOD * (1-Primary BOD Removal)]*(1-Secondary BOD Removal)\\

Therefore, 20 = [X*(1-0.35)] * (1-0.85)= X*0.65*0.15\\
$\implies 20 \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}= 0.0975X \implies X=\dfrac{20}{0.0975}=\boxed{205 \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}}$
