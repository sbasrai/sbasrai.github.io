\section{Units}\index{Units}

To measure any quantity or compare two physical quantities we need a universally accepted standard called Unit. The most common measurements involve measuring - length, weight and time.   International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system is the globally accepted standard.  In the United States, it is customary to measure the physical quantities in English Engineering Units.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{tabular}{c c c }

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Fundamental Units}} \\

\hline
time & second (s) & second (s) \\
length & foot (ft) & meter (m)\\
mass & pound mass (lb) & kilogram\\
\end{tabular}\\

\vspace{0.5cm}

The measurement of any physical quantity is expressed in terms of a number - which is the quantity and a specific unit.  
Thus, a measurement of 5000 ft is basically 5000 of the of length as measured in ft.

Using the fundamental physical measurements, mathematical calculations can be made to measure other physical quantities such as area (ft$2$), volume (ft$3$), velocity (ft/s), flow (ft$3$/s), density (lbs/ft$3$).

Depending on the what is being measured or quantified, there are appropriate and customary units of measure - for example - miles and inches for length, gallons and acre-ft for volume and milligrams and tons for mass.

\subsection{Unit Conversions}\index{Unit Conversions}
Unit conversion is a process for changing the units of a measured quantity without changing its value.  It involves 
utilizing a \hl{conversion factor} which expresses the relationship between units that is used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing the value. Examples of conversion factors include:\\

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{tabular}{l| c c }
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Fundamental Units}} \\
\hline

\hspace{0.3cm}
time & $\dfrac{60 \enspace sec}{min}$, $\dfrac{1,440\enspace sec}{day}$\\[0.5cm]
length & $\dfrac{12 \enspace in}{ft}$, $\dfrac{5,280 \enspace ft}{mile}$\\[0.5cm]
mass & $\dfrac{2,000 \enspace lbs}{ton}$, $\dfrac{1000 \enspace gm}{mg}$\\
\end{tabular}\\

\textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Conversion Factor}\\[0.5cm]

\hspace{0.3cm}
area & $\dfrac{43,560 \enspace ft^2}{acre}$, $\dfrac{60 \enspace sec}{min}$\\[0.5cm]
volume & $\dfrac{27 \enspace ft^3}{yd}$, $\dfrac{7.48 \enspace gal}{ft^3}$\\
\end{tabular}\\
\end{center}
\vspace{0.5cm}

The numerator and the denominator of any conversion factor always equals one, they have the same value expressed in different units.

For converting one measurement unit to another.

Step 1:  Make sure the original unit is for the same measurement as the conversion unit.  So if the original unit is for area, say ft$^2$ the conversion unit can be another area unit such as in$^2$ or acre but it cannot be gallons as gallon is a unit of volume.

Step 2: Write down the conversion formula as:

$Quantity \enspace in \enspace converted \enspace unit = Quantity \enspace (\cancel{Original \enspace Unit}) *   Conversion  \enspace Factor \enspace  \dfrac{Conversion \enspace unit}{\cancel{Original \enspace unit}}$\\
\hspace{0.2cm}
Unit conversions may involve single factor where the original unit value is multiplied by the conversion factor to obtain the measured parameter in the converted (desired) unit.\\
For example:\\  
Converting 1000 $ft^3$ to cu. yards:\\

$1000 \cancel{ft^3}*\dfrac{cu.yards}{27\cancel{ft^3}} = 37 cu.yards$\\

Other unit conversions may require multiplying by known constants along with conversion factors.\\
For example:\\
\begin{enumerate}  

\item Converting 3.5 $ft^3/sec$ to MGD:\\
$\dfrac{3.5 \enspace \cancel{ft^3}}{\cancel{sec}} * \dfrac{7.48\cancel {\enspace gal}}{\cancel{ft^3}} * \dfrac{MG}{\enspace 10^6 \cancel{gal}}* \dfrac{1440*60 \enspace \cancel{sec}}{day}=  2.3 \enspace MGD$\\

\item Converting 1,000 L water to lbs:\\
$1000 \enspace \cancel{L}*\dfrac {\cancel{gal}}{3.785 \enspace \cancel{L}}*\dfrac{8.34 \enspace lbs}{\cancel{gal}}\enspace  = 2,203 \enspace lbs$\\
$(Note:8.34 \enspace lbs/gal \enspace is \enspace density \enspace of \enspace water - a \enspace constant)$\\ 

\end{enumerate}
\section{Fractions}\index{Fractions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A fraction is defined as part of whole.  If in a class there are 20 male students and 30 male students, the fraction of male students is $\dfrac{20}{50} or \dfrac{2}{5}$.
\item It is composed of three items: two numbers and a line.
\item The number on the top is called the numerator, the number on the bottom is called the denominator, and the line in between them means to divide. 
$$
\text { Divide } \longrightarrow \dfrac{3}{4} \quad \begin{aligned}
&\text { Numerator } \\
&\text { Denominator }
\end{aligned}
$$
\item A proper fraction is a fraction that has no whole number part and its numerator is smaller than its denominator. An improper fraction is a fraction that has a larger numerator than denominator and it represents a number greater than one.\\
Proper Fraction Examples: $\dfrac{1}{2}$, $\dfrac{5}{8}$, $\dfrac{11}{12}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Improper Fraction Examples: $\dfrac{12}{2}$, $\dfrac{5}{2}$
\item Any whole number can be expressed as a fraction by placing a "1" in the denominator. For example:

2 is the same as $\dfrac{2}{1}$ and 45 is the same as $\dfrac{45}{1}$

\item Only fractions with the same denominator can be added/subtracted, and only the numerators are added/subtracted. For example:
$$
\dfrac{1}{8}+\dfrac{3}{8}=\dfrac{4}{8}  \enspace  \text {and},  \enspace \dfrac{7}{8}-\dfrac{3}{8}=\dfrac{4}{8}
$$

\item A fraction combined with a whole number is called a mixed number. For example:
$$
4 \dfrac{1}{8}, \enspace 16 \dfrac{2}{3}, \enspace  8 \dfrac{3}{4}, \enspace  45  \dfrac{1}{2} \text { and, } 12\dfrac{17}{32}
$$
These numbers are read, four and one eighth, sixteen and two thirds, eight and three fourths, forty-five and one half, and twelve and seventeen thirty seconds.\\
Mized numbers 

\item A fraction can be changed by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number. This does not change the value of the fraction, only how it looks. For instance:
$$
\dfrac{1}{2} \text { is the same as } \dfrac{1}{2} \times \dfrac{2}{2} \text { which is } \dfrac{2}{4}
$$

\item Steps to convert $\dfrac{17}{4}$ to a mixed number:
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item How many times can 4 fit into 17? 4 because 4×4=16.  Thus, 4 becomes the whole number part
\item How much is left over in the numerator? 1 because $17-16=1$.  Thus, 1 becomes the numerator of the fractional part
\item $\dfrac{17}{4} = 4\dfrac{1}{4}$
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item To turn a mixed number into an improper fraction, multiply the whole number part by the denominator and add the numerator. This becomes the new numerator over the original denominator.

Example: Converting 1.5 feet to fraction\\
$1.5ft=1\dfrac{1}{2}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$1\dfrac{1}{2}=\dfrac{1*2+1}{2}=\dfrac{2+1}{2}=\dfrac{3}{2}$
\vspace{0.2cm}
\item A mixed value - say a circumference is given in feet and fraction of feet (say $7 \enspace 3/4$), needs to be converted to a fraction for calculation purposes.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Ratio}\index{Ratio}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ratio is used for comparing the size of two or more quantities.
\item Say if there are 10 red cubes and 5 pink marbles in a bag, the ratio $\dfrac{5}{10}$ is the ratio of pink marbles and red cubes.  It can also be represented by 5:10.
\item 5 lbs of chemical in 10 gallons solution is a ratio.  So is 30 miles per gallon.
\item Unlike fractions, ratio does not compare things that have the same units.
\end{itemize}
\section{Proportion}\index{Proportion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two quantities are said to be in proportion if one changes, the other changes in a specific way.
\item Two quantities are said to be directly proportion, if the increase in one will \textbf{increase} the other value proportionally.  So if two quantities x and y are directly proportional, its ratio $\dfrac{x}{y}$ will be a fixed value. Thus for x$_1$ and y$_1$ different values of x and y respectively will be related by the equation $\dfrac{x}{y}=\dfrac{x_1}{y_1}$.  

\item This relationship is useful for calculating unknown values in water treatment calculations as in the following example: 

Knowing 200 lbs of bleach is needed to disinfect 5 MG of water at a treatment plant, calculate the lbs of bleach required to disinfect 3.2 MGD flow.

The ratio $\dfrac{200 \enspace pounds \enspace bleach}{5 MG}$ or 40 lbs bleach per MG is a constant.  Using this known proportion the lbs of bleach is needed to disinfect 3.2 MG at this plant can be calculated as follows by setting up the equation as:

$\dfrac{40 \enspace pounds \enspace bleach}{MG}=\dfrac{X}{3.2 \enspace MG}$ where X is the unknown lbs of bleach that is required to disinfect the 3.2 MG flow.

X can be calculated by cross multiplying the above equation: $X=\dfrac{3.2*40}{1}=128 \enspace lbs \enspace bleach$

\item Two quantities are said to be inversely proportional if the increase in one will decrease the second proportionally.  So if two quantities x and y are inversely proportional, its product $x * \text{y}$ will be a fixed value.  Examples of inversely proportional relationship include labor hours required to perform a certain task or time required to pump down a wetwell depending on the size of the pump.  An increase in assignment of labor hours will reduce the time required to perform the task or likewise putting a larger pump will reduce the time to pump down the wetwell.  So if two quantities x and y are inversely proportional, for x$_1$ and y$_1$ different values of x and y respectively will be related by the equation $x *y = x_1 * y_1$.

Application of inversely proportional relationship in water related calculation can be demonstration with the following example:

If it takes 20 minutes to pump a wet well down with one pump pumping at 125 gpm, then how long will it take if a 200 gpm pump is used?

As this is an inversely proportional relationship:

$(20 minutes * 125 gpm)=(X minutes * 200 gpm)$  where X is the unknown time to pump down the wetwell with the 200 gpm pump.

Solving for X: $X=\dfrac{20*125}{200}=12.5 minutes$
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Decimals \& Powers of Ten}\index{Decimals \& Powers of Ten}
\begin{itemize}
\item A decimal is composed of two sets of numbers: the numbers to the left of the decimal are whole numbers, and numbers to the right of the decimal are parts of whole numbers, a fraction of a number.\\

\item The term used to express the fraction component is dependent on the number of characters to the right of the decimal.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first character after the decimal point is tenths: $0.1$ - tenths

  \item The second character is hundredths: $0.01$ - hundredths

  \item The third character is thousandths: $0.001$ - thousandths
\end{itemize}

\item The term used to express the fraction component is dependent on the number of characters to the right of the decimal.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first character after the decimal point is tenths: $0.1$ - tenths

  \item The second character is hundredths: $0.01$ - hundredths

  \item The third character is thousandths: $0.001$ - thousandths
\end{itemize}

\item Powers of 10 notation enables us to work with these very large and small quantities efficiently.
\item In water math, the most common application of this concept is related to parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb).
\item 1 million - 1,000,000 can be represented as 10$^6$.  Likewise, 1 billion - 1,000, 000,000 can be represented as 10$^9$
\item The sequence of powers of ten can also be extended to negative powers.
\item 1 part per million (1/1,000,000) can be written as 10$^-6$
\end{itemize}

\section{Rounding and Significant Digits}\index{Rounding and Significant Digits}

\begin{itemize}
\item Significant digits (also called Significant Figures) are digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement and are related to rounding.
\item This concept is used to determine the direction to round a number (answer). The basic idea is that no answer can be more accurate than the least accurate piece of data used to calculate the answer.\\
\item Significant digits is the count of the numerals in a measured quantity (counting from the left) whose values are considered as known exactly, plus one more whose value could be one more or one less.\\
\item Rules for determining the number of significant digits:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All nonzero digits are significant:\\
1.234 g has 4 significant figures, and 1.2 g has 2 significant figures.
\item Zeroes between nonzero digits are significant:
1002 kg has 4 significant figures, 3.07 mL has 3 significant figures.
\item Zeroes to the left of the first nonzero digits are not significant; such zeroes merely indicate the position of the decimal point:
\SI{0.001}{\celsius} has only 1 significant figure, 0.012 g has 2 significant figures.
\item Zeroes to the right of a decimal point in a number are significant:
0.023 mL has 2 significant figures, 0.200 g has 3 significant figures.
\item When a number ends in zeroes that are not to the right of a decimal point, the zeroes are not necessarily significant:
190 miles may be 2 or 3 significant figures, 50,600 calories may be 3, 4, or 5 significant figures. The potential ambiguity in the last rule can be avoided by the use of standard exponential, or ”scientific,” notation. For example, depending on whether 3, 4, or 5 significant figures is correct, we could write 50,6000 calories as: $5.06*10^4$ calories (3 significant figures) $5.060*10^4$ calories (4 significant figures), or
$5.0600*10^4)$ calories (5 significant figures).
\end{enumerate}
\item Examples of significant figures:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|p{16cm}|}
\hline
1000 has   one significant digit: only the 1 is interesting (only it tells us anything   specific); we don't know anything for sure about the hundreds, tens, or units   places; the zeroes may just be placeholders; they may have rounded something   off to get this value.                                     \\ \hline
1000.0 has five significant   digits: the ".0" tells us something interesting about the presumed   accuracy of the measurement being made; namely, that the measurement is   accurate to the tenths place, but that there happen to be zero tenths.                                                                \\ \hline
0.00035 has two significant   digits: only the 3 and 5 tell us something; the other zeroes are   placeholders, only providing information about relative size.                                                                                                                                                     \\ \hline
0.000350 has three significant   digits: the last zero tells us that the measurement was made accurate to that   last digit, which just happened to have a value of zero.                                                                                                                                          \\ \hline

560. : notice that   "point" after the zero! This has three significant digits, because   the decimal point tells us that the measurement was made to the nearest unit,   so the zero is not just a placeholder.                                                                                                   \\ \hline
560.0 has four significant   digits: the zero in the tenths place means that the measurement was made   accurate to the tenths place, and that there just happen to be zero tenths;   the 5 and 6 give useful information, and the other zero is between   significant digits, and must therefore also be counted. \\ \hline

\item Addition and Subtraction\\
\begin{itemize}
\item When you are \hl{adding or subtracting} a bunch of numbers and need to be concerned with significant figures, first add (or subtract) the numbers given in their entire format, and then round the final answer. \hl{When rounding the final answer after adding or subtracting, the answer must be written with the same significant figures as the least accurate decimal place given}.\\
\textbf{Example:} 13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38\\
\begin{itemize}
\item 13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38 = 261.2290\\
\item 234.6 is only accurate to the tenths place making it the least accurate number. My answer must be rounded to the same place as the least accurate number:\\
\item 261.2290 rounds to 261.2 (one decimal place)\\
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Multiplication and Division\\
\begin{itemize}
\item When \hl{multiplying or dividing} multiple numbers you would do these calculations as normal. When the answer must be written in the appropriate significant figure your answer must \hl{round to the same number of significant figures as the least number of significant figures.}\\
\textbf{Example 1:}  Simplify, and round, to the appropriate number of significant digits \\
\begin{center}
16.235 x 0.217 x 5\\
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item First off, 5 has only one significant figure, thus the final answer needs to be rounded to one significant digit\\
\item 16.235 x 0.217 x 5 = 17.614975\\
\item To round 17.614975 to one digit. I'll start with the 1 in the tens place. Immediately to its right is a 7, which is greater than 5, so 1 is rounded up to 2, and then replacing the 7 with a zero, and dropping the decimal point and everything after it.
\item 17.614975 rounds to 20\\
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Example 2:}  Simplify, and round, to the appropriate number of significant figures\\
\begin{center}
0.00435 x 4.6
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item 4.6 has only 2 significant figures, so the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.
\item 0.00435 x 4.6 = 0.02001\\
\item 0.02001 would round to 0.020, which has 2 significant figures (0.020). The answer cannot be 0.02, because that value would have only one significant figure.\\
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{A number is rounded off by dropping one or more numbers from the right and adding zeroes, if necessary, to maintain the decimal point.} 
\item \emph{If the last figure dropped is 5 or more, increase the last retained figure by 1. If the last digit dropped is less than 5, do not increase the last retained figure.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Averages}\index{Averages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Also known as \emph{arithmetic mean}, this value is arrived at by adding the quantities in a series and dividing the total by the number in the series.
\end{itemize}
Example 1: Find the average of the following series of numbers: 12,8,6,21,4,5 , 9 , and 12.\\
Adding the numbers together we get 77.\\
There are 8 numbers in this set.\\
Divide 77 by 8.\\

$\frac{77}{8}=9.6$ is the average of the set\\

Example 2:  Find the average of the set of daily turbidity data - 0.3,0.4,0.3,0.1,and 0.8\\
The total is 1.9.\\
There are 5 numbers in the set.\\
Therefore:
$$
\frac{1.9}{5}=0.38, \text { rounding off }=0.4
$$

\section{Working with Percent}\index{Working with Percent}
\begin{itemize}
\item Percent expresses portions of the whole.  
\item \texthl{The whole is considered as 1 or 100\% and a part of the whole can be expressed as a percent.}
\textbf{Example:} If a tank is $1 / 2$ full, we say that it contains $50 \%$ of the original solution.
\item Percentage is written as a whole number with a \% sign after it. 
\item In a calculation, percent is expressed as a decimal. 
\item \texthl{The decimal form of a percent value is obtained by dividing the percent by 100.}\\
 \textbf{Example:} $11 \%$ is expressed as the decimal $0.11$, since $11 \%$ is equal to $11 / 100$. This decimal is obtained by dividing 11 by 100.
\item \texthl{To determine what percentage a part is of the whole, divide the part by the whole.}\\
\textbf{Example:} There are 80 water meters to read, Jim has finished 24 of them. What percentage of the meters have been read?\\
$$24 \div 80=0.30$$\\
The $0.30$ is converted to percent by multiplying the answer by 100.\\
$$0.30 \times 100=30 \%$$\\
Thus $30 \%$ of the 80 meters have been read.\\

\item \texthl{To find the percentage of a number, multiply the number by the decimal equivalent of the percentage given in the problem.}\\
\textbf{Example:}\\
What is $28 \%$ of $286 ?$\\

\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item Change the $28 \%$ to a decimal equivalent:  $$28 \% \div 100=0.28$$
\item Multiply $286 \times 0.28=80$\\
Thus $28 \%$ of 286 is 80.
\end{enumerate}

\item \texthl{To increase a value by a percent, add the decimal equivalent of the percent percent to " 1 " and multiply it times the number.}

\textbf{Example:} A filter bed will expand $25 \%$ during backwash. If the filter bed is 36 inches deep, how deep will it be during backwash?\\

\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item Change the percent to a decimal.
$$
25 \% \div 100=0.25
$$
\item Add the whole number 1 to this value.
$$
1+0.25=1.25
$$
\item Multiply times the value.
$$
36 \text { in } \times 1.25=45 \text { inches }
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Percentage Concentrations}
Above concepts are used for chemicals such as fluoride and hypochlorites - the strength of the product as used is commonly expressed as a percentage.

\textbf{Example 1:} A chlorine solution was made to have a $4 \%$ concentration. It is often desirable to determine this concentration in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. This is relatively simple: the $4 \%$ is four percent of a million.

To find the concentration in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ when it is expressed in percent, do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Change the percent to a decimal.
\end{enumerate}
$$
4 \% \div 100=0.04
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Multiply times a million.
\end{enumerate}
$$
0.04 \times 1,000,000=40,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}
$$
We get the million because a liter of water weighs $1,000,000 \mathrm{mg} .1 \mathrm{mg}$ in 1 liter is 1 part in a million parts ( $\mathrm{ppm}) .1 \%=10,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$.


\textbf{Example 2:} How much $65 \%$ calcium hypochlorite is required to obtain 7 pounds of pure chlorine?\\
$65 \%$ implies that in every lb of calcium hypochlorite has $65 \%$ lbs of available chlorine.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Therefore, $\dfrac{0.65 \textrm{ lbs available chlorine}}{\textrm{lb of calcium hypochlorite}} $ or conversely $\dfrac{\textrm{lb of calcium hypochlorite}}{0.65 \textrm{ lbs available chlorine}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies{\textrm{lbs calcium hypchlorite required}}=\dfrac{\textrm{lb of calcium hypochlorite}}{0.65 \cancel{\textrm{ lbs available chlorine}}}*\dfrac{7\cancel{\textrm{ lb of available chlorine}}}{}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$=\boxed{10.8 \textrm{ lbs of calcium hypochlorite with } 65\%\textrm{available chlorine is required}}$

\section{Concentration}\index{Concentration}

Concentration is typically expressed as mg/l which is the weight of the constituent (mg) in 1 l (liter) of solution (wastewater).  As 1 l of water weighs 1 million mg, a concentration of 1 mg/l implies 1 mg of constituent per 1 million mg of water or one part per million (ppm).   \textbf{Thus, mg/l and ppm are synonymous.}\\  
Sometimes the constituent concentration is expressed in terms of percentage.\\
\vspace{6pt}
For example:  sludge containing 5\% solids or a 12.5\% chlorine concentration solution.\\
\vspace{6pt}
As one liter of water weighs 1,000,000 mg, one percent of that weight is 10,000 mg.  So 1\% solids implies 10,000 mg of solids per liter or 10,000 mg/l or 10,000 ppm.\\
\vspace{6pt}
$1\% concentration = 10,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace\dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
\vspace{6pt}
$0.1\% concentration = 1,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
\vspace{6pt}
$0.01\% concentration = 100 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
\vspace{6pt}
$10\% concentration = 100,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
\vspace{6pt}
$5\% concentration = 50,000 \enspace ppm \enspace or \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}$\\
\vspace{6pt}
$A \enspace  12.5\% \enspace bleach \enspace solution \enspace contains \enspace 12.5\% \enspace or \enspace 125,000 \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l} \enspace of \enspace \enspace active \enspace chlorine $

% 	\item \noindent\textsc{Process Removal Efficiency}
% \end{snugshade*}
\begin{itemize}
\item Process removal rate or removal efficiency is the percentage of the inlet concentration removed.  
\item It is used for quantifying the pollutant removal during wastewater treatment and is established based upon the amount of a particular wastewater constituent entering and leaving a treatment process.

\item $Process \enspace Removal \enspace Rate \enspace (\%) = \dfrac{Pollutant \enspace  In-Pollutant\enspace  Out}{Pollutant \enspace In}*100$\\

\item If 10 units of a pollutant are entering a process and 8 units of pollutant are leaving (process removes 2 units), then the process removal rate for that pollutant is (10-8)/10*100=20\%.  In this example the process is 20\% efficient in removing that particular pollutant.

\item The amount of pollutant can be measured in terms of concentration (mg/l) or in terms of mass loading (lbs).  The pounds formula is used for calculating the mass loadings.  
\end{itemize}
The above example is for calculating the removal efficiency using the inlet and outlet concentrations or mass loading.\\
The methods below can be used for calculating either the inlet or outlet pollutant concentrations, if the removal efficiency and the corresponding inlet or outlet concentrations are given.

$\dfrac{In}{Out} \enspace : \enspace \dfrac{Actual \enspace inlet \enspace  (X)}{80}=\dfrac{100}{100-60}\implies \dfrac{Actual \enspace inlet \enspace  (X)}{80}=2.5$\\    
Rearranging the equation:   $Actual \enspace inlet (X)=2.5*80 = \boxed{200 mg/l}$\\

For the Secondary process:\\
$\dfrac{In}{Out}: \enspace \dfrac{0.65X}{20}=\dfrac{100}{15} \implies X \enspace mg/l=\dfrac{100*20}{15*0.65}=\boxed{205 \enspace mg/l}$\\

\hspace{2.8cm}$\downarrow$ {\tiny(0.35X)BOD Removed}\hspace{3.2cm}$\downarrow$ {\tiny(0.65*0.85)X = 0.5525X BOD Removed}\\
$\implies 0.0975X=20 \implies X=\dfrac{20}{0.0975}=\boxed{205\dfrac{mg}{l}}$\\

\vspace{0.3cm}

Alternate Solution \#2:\\
$\xrightarrow[\text{X}\dfrac{mg}{l}]{\text{Influent BOD}}\boxed{Primary}\xrightarrow[\text{0.65X}]{\text{Primary Effluent BOD}}\boxed{Secondary}\xrightarrow[\text{(0.65*0.15)X}]{\text{Secondary Effluent BOD}}$\\
\hspace{2.8cm}$\downarrow$ {\tiny(0.35X)BOD Removed}\hspace{2.2cm}$\downarrow$ {\tiny(0.65X*0.85)BOD Removed}\\

Primary Effluent BOD = Influent BOD * (1-Primary BOD Removal), and\\
Secondary Effluent BOD=[Primary Effluent BOD]*(1-Secondary BOD Removal)\\
Secondary Eff. BOD=[Influent BOD * (1-Primary BOD Removal)]*(1-Secondary BOD Removal)\\

Therefore, 20 = [X*(1-0.35)] * (1-0.85)= X*0.65*0.15\\
$\implies 20 \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}= 0.0975X \implies X=\dfrac{20}{0.0975}=\boxed{205 \enspace \dfrac{mg}{l}}$
