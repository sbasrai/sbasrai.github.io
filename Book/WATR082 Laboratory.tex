		\section{Wastewater constituents}\index{Wastewater constituents}		
		\subsection{Wastewater organics}\index{Wastewater organics}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The main reason for treating domestic wastewater is to remove the organic matter.  
			\item Organics are substances containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and some of which may be combined with nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorous.
			\item About 50 percent of the solids present in wastewater are organic.  This fraction is generally of animal or vegetable life, dead animal matter, plant tissue or organisms, and also include synthetic organic compounds.
			\item The principal organic compounds present in domestic wastewater are proteins, carbohydrates and fats together with the products of their decomposition.
			\item Organics are subject to decay or decomposition through the activity of bacteria and other living organisms.  \hl{Since the organic fraction can be driven off at high temperatures, they are also called \textbf{volatile solids}}.\
			\item \emph{Organics in wastewater is typically quantified in terms of oxygen required to oxidize the carbon based material present} in wastewater using the following methods:\\
\subsubsection{Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)}\index{Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)}

			  %     		\item \noindent\textsc{Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)}%@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@%
			  %     	\end{snugshade*}					
			      	\begin{itemize}
			      		\item The BOD of wastewater is measured in terms of oxygen required for the microorganisms to consume the organic material present.
			      		\item BOD is typically measured as BOD$_5$ which is the oxygen demand of the wastewater measured after 5 days of the initiation of the test.
			      		\item The test involves incubating a known dilution of wastewater in a 300 ml bottle for 5 days at 20\si{\degree}C.  The dissolved oxygen (DO) content at the start and end of the incubation period is used for calculating the BOD.
			      		\item For the test to be considered valid, the following criteria need to be met: 1) DO consumption during the test must be at least 2 mg/l, 2) DO remaining at the end of the test must be at least 1 mg/l, and 3) DO consumed in blank should be 0.2 mg/l or less
			      		      			
			      		\item BOD is a parameter to measure the strength of wastewater and the measurement of the wastewater treatment plant or treatment process influent and effluent BOD is standard practice to measure its performance.  Typical domestic wastewater BOD is about 200-250 mg/l.
			      		\item The oxygen consumed by the microorganisms during the BOD test is primarily for: 1) Oxidizing the carbonaceous material (cBOD – carbonaceous BOD), and 2) Oxidizing nitrogenous constituents such as ammonia (nBOD – nitrogenous BOD).
			      		\item Thus, BOD (Total) = cBOD + nBOD.  The cBOD and nBOD is measured by adding certain chemical inhibitors which will inhibit the bacteria responsible for consuming the nitrogenous matter, thus measuring only the cBOD as part of the BOD test.
			      		\item Since not all of the organics is metabolized in the 5 days of the regular BOD test, certain wastewater discharge permits require reporting of the ultimate BOD value (BOD$_U$)\\
			      	\end{itemize}

			      	% \end{snugshade*}		  
			      	\begin{itemize}
			      		\item The COD test involves using chemical oxidizers to measure the oxygen demand of the wastewater.
			      		\item As the chemical oxidizers will oxidize other constituents present, including inorganic matter, the COD value of wastewater will be higher than the BOD.  
			      		\item The COD test can be conducted rather quickly than the 5 day BOD test, it is an effective method to quantify the wastewater strength and process efficiencies and allow operators to make timely process adjustments.
			      	\end{itemize}

			    \subsubsection{Total Organic Carbon (TOC)}
			      	% \begin{snugshade*}
			      	% 	\item \noindent\textsc{Total Organic Carbon (TOC):}\\%@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@%
			      	% \end{snugshade*}
			      	The TOC method utilizes laboratory analytical instruments which directly measure the organic carbon content by quantifying the amount of carbon dioxide produced from the complete combustion of the organics present.
			      % \end{enumerate}
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		
			\hl{Note: BOD measures the amount of oxygen required by the microorganisms present to consume the organic material while COD measures the chemical oxidation required to oxidize all chemicals including organics present in wastewater.  BOD value of typical domestic sewage is about 200 - 250 mg/l while the COD value ranges from 300 - 450 mg/l.  Typical BOD:COD ratio ranges from 0.5-0.8.}\\
\subsubsection{BOD Analysis}\index{BOD Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}

\item The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) test estimates the amount of biodegradable material present by measuring the amount of oxygen used by the bacteria to break down the organic waste in the sample incubated at 20 deg. C over a five-day period . The BOD test provides an indication on the strength of wastewater in terms of how much oxygen could be depleted if that wastewater was introduced into another receiving water.  Complete stabilization of a sample may require a period of incubation too long for practical purposes; therefore, 5 days has been accepted as the standard incubation period.

\item As the regular BOD test includes estimation of oxygen nitrifying bacteria consumes in the process of converting inorganic forms of ammonia and nitrogen to nitrite and nitrate, its value represents oxygen used for removing both, organic material and nitrogenous matter.  As this BOD value does not quite represent the organic strength of the wastewater, the normal BOD test is modified by introducing a chemical inhibitor - 3 mg of 2-chloro-6-(trichloro methyl) pyridine (TCMP), which suppresses the growth of the nitrogenous bacteria so that the resultant BOD measured represents the oxygen depletion associated with the depletion of the organic matter only.  This is the Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand or cBOD. \\
\vspace{0.4cm}
\textbf{Thus tBOD = nBOD + cBOD}

\item Wastewater BOD measurement involves testing a sample set consisting of several sample dilutions along with a "Blank".  "Blank" is a sample with only the dilution water with no wastewater added. \\

\vspace{0.4cm}



\item The dilutions are made based upon the expected BOD concentration of the sample.  Using the final dilution volume of 300 ml, the initial sample volume can be estimated using the formula:\\
\vspace{0.4cm}

\textbf{$Sample \enspace Volume (ml) = \dfrac{\Big[Oxygen \enspace Depletion \Big(\dfrac{mg}{l}\Big)\Big]}{Anticipated \enspace BOD \Big(\dfrac{mg}{l}\Big)}*300 \enspace ml$}\\

\vspace{0.4cm}
\item For example, if testing an influent wastewater BOD with an expected BOD value of 250 mg/l, a range of sample volumes for dilution around sample volume of $\dfrac{4\dfrac{mg}{l}}{250 \dfrac{mg}{l}}*300 \enspace ml$=5ml.\\
\vspace{0.4cm}
\item The data obtained for each of the dilutions after the 5-day incubation period must meet the following criteria for the sample value to be acceptable for calculating the BOD.\\
\vspace{0.4cm}

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\setlength\itemsep{1em}

\item A residual DO of at least 1 mg/L,
\item A DO depletion of at least 2 mg/L
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.4cm}
\item Additionally, the whole sample set is rejected if the Blank shows an oxygen depletion of >0.2mg/l.\\
\vspace{0.4cm}
\item BOD is calculated for each sample dilution value using the following formula:\\
\vspace{0.4cm}
\textbf{$BOD \Big(\dfrac{mg}{l}\Big) = \dfrac{Initial \enspace DO - DO \enspace Day \enspace 5}{Sample \enspace Volume \enspace (ml)}*300 \enspace ml$}\\



\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.4cm}
\subsection{Wastewater solids}\index{Wastewater solids}
		Like BOD, wastewater solids is another critical parameter for establishing the wastewater strength and determining treatment process efficiencies. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The \texthl{solids can be classified as suspended or dissolved} based upon its ability to pass through a standardized filter paper.
			\item When the wastewater is filtered:
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item the residual solids remaining on the filter paper after drying in an oven at 103\si{\degree}C is the \hl{suspended solids} portion, and 
			      	\item the solids remaining after drying the filtrate are the \hl{dissolved solids}.
			      \end{itemize}
			\item Suspended solids include larger floating particles and consist of sand, grit, clay, fecal matter, paper, pieces of wood, particles of food and garbage, and similar materials.
			\item Suspended solids can be categorized based upon its settling characteristics as:
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item \hl{Settleable}
			      	\item \hl{Non-settleable}
			      	      \begin{itemize}
			      	      	\item \hl{Colloidial}-small, charged (typically negative) particles which do not settle easily.  Some of the colloidial particles are small enough to pass through the filter paper used for filtering the suspended solids
			      	      	\item \hl{Floatable}-example oil and grease and small plastics
			      	      \end{itemize}
			      \end{itemize}
			\item Dissolved solids in wastewater include organics.  However, the major elements of dissolved solids are inorganic ions such as Ca$^{+2}$, Mg$^{+2}$, Cl$^-$, SO$_4$ $^{-2}$ , HCO$_3$ $^-$, Fe$^{+2}$, PO$_4$ $^{-3}$, NO$_3$ $^-$.  These ions are part of the dissolved salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO$_3$)$_2$), magnesium phosphate (Mg$_3$PO$_4$) and others which are normally present in water and wastewater. 
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item Conductivity or electrical conductance (EC) measurement is typically conducted as the wastewater enters the plant as \hl{conductivity provides an indirect and simple measure of the amount of dissolved solids present.}  
			      	\item Conductivity or electrical conductance (EC) is a measure the amount of electrical current that can be conducted by a solution.  
			      	\item The conductance of electricity in a solution is due to the presence of dissolved inorganic ions 
			      	\item The higher the concentration of these ions, the higher is the conductivity. 
			      	\item \underline{Conductivity is measured in the units of mhos/cm or Siemens/cm.}  (Note:  mhos is the reverse of ohm which is a measure of resistance).
			      	\item Typical wastewater conductivities range from 50 to 1500 S/cm
			      \end{itemize}
			\item Both suspended and dissolved solids can be either \hl{volatile (organic)} or \hl{fixed (inorganic)}.
			\item \hl{Total Solids is thus a sum of TSS and dissolved solids or volatile and fixed solids.}
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item The volatile solids are typically of plant or animal origin .
			      	\item The fixed solids include sand, gravel and silt as well as the dissolved salts.

			      	\item The volatile or fixed fractions are quantified by incinerating the solids in a muffler furnace at 550\si{\degree} which removes only the volatile solids leaving only the fixed solids behind.
			      	\item In terms of the size of the solids, the distribution is approximately thirty percent suspended and about seventy percent dissolved solids - which includes the colloidal particles which have passed through the filter paper.\\ 
			      	\item As primary treatment process involve settling of solids, establishing the settleable portion of the suspended solids is important.\\  
			      	\item \hl{The settleable solids are quantified using an Imhoff cone and are reported in ml/L}.  Imhoff cone is a 1 liter, clear cone shaped container, with volume graduations (ml) at the bottom.

 \end{figure}




			      	\item One factor which affects settleability is the conveyance time of the sewage to the treatment plant. 			
			      	\item The settleable component of the suspended solids will decrease as the sewage becomes more septic due to longer conveyance times.
			\item Influent and effluent total suspended solids are measured to establish the overall treatment and individual process efficiencies.  
			\item Volatile solids measurements before and after biological processes such as secondary treatment and digestion provide information on the process efficiency.\\

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Plant nutrients - nitrogen and phosphorous, present in wastewater effluent discharge, promote growth of plant and algal matter in the receiving waters causing destruction of the normal aquatic life mainly due to oxygen depletion - eutrophication.
				      
				\item Because of the potential impacts of the presence of these nutrients in wastewater effluent on the receiving waters,  limits on the levels of these nutrients is typically stipulated in the treatment plant's wastewater discharge permit.
				      
				\item Typically, conventional secondary treatment processes are designed primarily remove the organics from the wastewater.  Secondary treatment process designed to additionally remove nutrients is deemed as tertiary or advanced treatment is termed as Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR).

% 				\begin{itemize}
% 					\item Forms of nitrogen:\\
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item About 60\% of nitrogen in wastewater is present as ammonia nitrogen (about 60\%).  The ammonium nitrogen is present either in the form of ammonia (NH$_3$ ) or as ammonium (NH$_4^+$ ) ion.   These two forms can rapidly change from one to the other depending on pH and temperature.  Under low pH (acidic) or neutral conditions – pH less than or equal to 7, ammonia exists mostly as ammonium.  Ammonia becomes the dominant form as the pH increases to 8 and beyond.
					      	\item The other dominant form of nitrogen, about 40\% of the total nitrogen is as organic nitrogen
					      	\item Nitrogen measured as Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) which is the sum of the organic nitrogen and the ammonia nitrogen concentrations.  Total inorganic nitrogen is the total concentration of ammonia nitrogen, NO3-, and NO2-.   Table provides the concentrations and forms of nitrogen in wastewater.

\textbf{\textit{Forms of phosphorous}}
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item The principal forms are organically bound phosphorus, polyphosphates, and orthophosphates.
					      	\item Organically bound phosphorus originates from body and food waste and, upon biological decomposition of these solids, is converted to orthophosphates. 
					      	\item Polyphosphates originate from synthetic detergents and are hydrolyzed to orthophosphates. Thus, the principal form of phosphorus in wastewater is assumed to be orthophosphates, although the other forms may exist. Orthophosphates consist of the negative ions PO$_4$$^{3-}$, HPO$_4$$^{2-}$, and H$_2$PO$_4$ $^-$.  These may form chemical combinations with cations (positively charged ions).
					      \end{itemize}

\subsection{Oil and Grease}\index{Oil and Grease}	
			Fats, oil and grease in wastewater originate from homes, food establishments and industries.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Oil and grease content of wastewater is established in the laboratory by extracting it with a solvent - \textit{n}-hexane.  The concentration of oil and grease is reported in mg/l and typical oil and grease content of wastewater ranges from 80 - 120 mg/l
				\item Presence of excessive oils and grease could potentially impact the secondary treatment process
				\item Oils and grease are removed as floatables in primary treatment and sent with the sludge to the digesters
			\end{itemize}
		



\section{Wastewater Parameters}\index{Wastewater Parameters}			
		Laboratory and field tests are conducted to measure parameters which are critical for monitoring and controlling treatment.  The following are the key parameters that are measured.	
			
\subsection{pH}\index{pH}	
			\hl{pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion (H$^+$) content or the acidity or basicity of a solution.}  pH impacts the chemical and micribiological elements of wastewater treatment processes and thus pH measurement and control is critical.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Pure water dissociates into equal concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions:\\ 
				      $H_2O \rightarrow H^+ + OH^-$.
				\item The H$^+$ are responsible for acidic properties and the OH$^-$ ions for the basic properties.  
				\item pH is the inverse of H$^+$ concentration; pH increases when the concentration of H$^+$ decreases relative to the concentration of OH-. 
				\item pH scale ranges from 0 – 14. When the concentration of both H$^+$ and OH$^-$ are equal, as in pure water, it is considered neutral and its pH is 7.0.  \item If the pH of a sample solution is below 7.0, the sample is termed acidic and is alkaline or basic if its pH is above 7.0. 
				\item Each change of 1 pH unit represents a 10 fold change in concentration.  For example, a sample with a pH of 2.0 is 1000 times more acidic than a sample with a pH of 5.0. 
				\item pH is measured by an electrode that is sensitive only to H$^+$ or using a pH strip which is essentially an adsorbent paper which is pre-impregnated with chemicals which change color under different H$^+$ concentrations.
				\item Most organisms involved in biological wastewater treatment processes do well within a a narrow range of pH near neutral (pH of 7).			
			\end{itemize}
			
\subsection{Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP)}\index{Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP)}			
			ORP is a measure of the potential of a wastewater to allow for microbiological oxidation and reduction reactions.\\
			An example of wastewater treatment process where microbiological oxidation involved include the activated sludge process.  Whereas, anaerobic digestion is a microbiological reduction based process.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item ORP value is measured in millivolts (mV), using an electrochemical probe
				\item The measured ORP value provides an indication of the potential of oxidation and reduction reactions in that sample.
				\item A higher positive ORP is indicative of oxidation potential of the wastewater whereas a negative ORP value indicates potential for a reduction reaction to occur.
				\item ORP measurements are used for controlling treatment processes including nitrification, odor control and disinfection.  For example, in the disinfection process utilizing chlorine (bleach), ORP measurements provides the strength of the oxidation potential of chlorine present in the wastewater being disinfected.  This measurement is used for precisely controlling the chlorine dosing.  The proper chlorine control results in optimizing chlorine dosing which reduces potential toxicity issues and dechlorination costs.
			\end{itemize}
			Typical ORP applications include the following processes and process elements

\end{table}			
\subsection{Alkalinity}\index{Alkalinity}	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \hl{Alkalinity is the ability of a water to neutralize acids.}  
				\item During certain wastewater treatment processes including anaerobic digestion, acids are generated as a result of microbiological activity.  The bacteria and other biological entities which play an active role in wastewater treatment are most effective at a neutral to slightly alkaline pH of 7 to 8.  In order to maintain these optimal pH conditions for biological activity there must be sufficient alkalinity present in the wastewater to neutralize acids generated by the active biomass.
				\item This ability to maintain the proper pH in the wastewater as it undergoes treatment is the reason why alkalinity is so important to the wastewater industry.
				\item The alkalinity is due to the presence of acid neutralizing bases in the water including the hydroxyl (OH$^-$), carbonate (CO$_3$$^-$) and bicarbonate (HCO$_3$$^-$)  ions.  These ions are of mineral origin and are also formed from carbon dioxide which comes from the atmosphere and from the microbial decomposition of organic material.  The resistance to pH change of the water will continue until all the alkalinity contributing ions are neutralized.  
				\item The pH of a water serves as a guide to the types of alkalinity present in the water but is unrelated to the alkalinity content of a water.  Important Note:  Alkalinity is a measure of the ability to neutralize acids whereas a solution is termed alkaline (or basic) if its pH greater than 7. 
				\item Alkalinity is expressed as milligrams per liter of CaCO$_3$
			\end{itemize}
			
\subsection{Dissolved Oxygen}\index{Dissolved Oxygen}	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the wastewater sample and is typically measured in the field using a DO probe.  A titration based Winkler Test is used in the laboratory
				\item The \hl{presence of oxygen indicates an aerobic environment} where dissolved, free oxygen is available for aerobic microorganisms to live, BOD removal in the activated sludge process occurs as a result of the activity of aerobic bacteria.  The absence of DO indicates that the environment or condition is either anoxic or anaerobic.  
				\item \hl{In an anoxic environment, free oxygen is not present, but oxygen is available from its combined  forms - nitrate (NO$_3$ $^-$) and sulfate (SO$_4$ $^-$)} for the the consumption of microorganisms.  Example of an anoxic process is denitrification.  In denitrification, the anoxic bacteria in the presence of food (cBOD) consume the combined oxygen in nitrates (NO$_3$ $^-$ ) and convert it to nitrogen gas.
				\item \hl{The complete absence of oxygen including free and combined oxygen is an anaerobic environment.}
				\item Microorganisms are termed as obligate aerobes if they cannot survive without free oxygen.  Facultative aerobes are microorganisms which can survive in both aerobic and anaerobic environments.  
			\end{itemize}
		\section{Laboratory analysis}\index{Laboratory analysis}			
\subsection{Microbiological testing and monitoring}\index{Microbiological testing and monitoring}	
			
			Microbiological testing and monitoring is conducted as part of the wastewater treatment for two main reasons:
			\begin{enumerate}[1.]
				\item Heterotrohic (organisms that consume organic material) microbes are responsible for the biological wastewater treatment processes - secondary treatment process, digestion and nutrient removal; and
				\item Pathogens - agents that cause disease are present in wastewater effluent.
			\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
				
				\item Microbiological testing related to monitoring and troubleshooting biological wastewater treatment\\
				
				Microbes involved in biological wastewater treatment processes include:\\
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Fungi - Filamentous fungi occasionally bloom in activated sludge processes due to low pH or nutrient deficiency and cause problems with the settleability.
					\item Protozoa - Protozoas play a important role in the secondary treatment process.  Common protozoas in the activated sludge process include:
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item Amoeba
					      	\item Flagellate
					      	\item Cilliate
					      \end{itemize}
					\item Rotifers
					\item Nematodes
					\item Bacteria - Bacteria is the predominant microorganism responsible for the biological wastewater water treatment.  
				\end{itemize}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The effectiveness of the biological wastewater treatment processes is primarily due to the presence of a microbial ecosystem with a right balance of populations of different microbial species.
					\item Methods used for monitoring the microbial composition include direct monitoring using a light microscope to see which and how many of the different microbial species are present - typically used for activated sludge process.
					\item Indirect method includes monitoring other parameters such as pH and alkalinity which are influenced by microbiological activity.
					\item The microbial monitoring ensures process stability and helps identify potential process upset conditions caused by changes to the microbial population due to other external factors - toxicty, organic loading, temperature etc.
				\end{itemize}

\item Microbiological testing related to monitoring and controlling pathogens in treated wastewater effluent\\

	
				Pathogens in wastewater belong to the following groups:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Bacteria:  Although, bacteria is present in large numbers in feces, pathogenic or bacteria are present only because of an infection and this pathogenic bacteria can potentially spread the infection to other healthy individuals.  Disease spread by pathogenic bacteria include diarrhea, cholera and typhoid among many others.
					      
					\item Viruses: A large number of viruses may infect humans and are present in feces.  These include enteroviruses (including polioviruses), hepatitis A virus, reoviruses and diarrhea-causing viruses (especially rotavirus).
					      
					\item Protozoa:  Many species of protozoa can infect humans and cause diarrhoea and dysentery. Girardia which casues diarrheal illness is an example of a protozoan pathogen
					      
					\item Helminths:  These are parasitic worms that can infect humans and are transmitted to others through its eggs or larval forms
					      
				\end{itemize}
				
				\begin{itemize}
					\item As one of the main reasons for treating wastewater is to protect public health, microbiological/pathogen testing of the wastewater effluent and the surface water impacted by the wastewater discharge is conducted to meet the requirements of a wastewater discharge permit, to monitor the pathogen impact of treated wastewater discharge and assess the level of contamination of a public body of water.
					\item The bacteriological tests involves detection and quantification of one or more of the following bacteria:  total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. Coli, and Enterococcus.  
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item The main reason why these bacteria such as coliforms and enterococcus are used \hl{as it is not practical to detect and quantify all pathogens associated with wastewater.}  
					      	\item These selected bacteria originate from feces and indicate fecal contamination and thus serve as an indicator organisms for pathogens of wastewater origin.  
					      	\item Also, they are abundant, potentially less harmful, and easy to detect.  E. coli has been shown to be a better predictor of the potential for impacts to human health and therefore many newer wastewater discharge permits require E. Coli testing in lieu of fecal coliform testing requirements.
					      \end{itemize}
					\item The microbiological test sample is always collected as a grab in a clean, sterile borosilicate glass or plastic bottle containing sodium thiosulfate. 
					      \begin{itemize}
					      	\item Sodium thiosulfate is added to remove residual chlorine which will kill coliforms during transit. 
					      	\item If the sample is not preserved or maintained under proper conditions until the test is conducted in the laboratory, the test would provide erroneous results.
					      	\item Samples must be refrigerated if they cannot be analyzed within 1 hour of collection and must be handled with care to prevent contamination and adverse conditions such as prolonged exposure to direct sunlight.
					      	\item The maximum holding time for state or federal permit reporting purposes is 6 hours. 
					      \end{itemize} 
					\item As it is not possible to exactly quantify the number of bacteria present, a statistical based - \hl{Most Probable Number (MPN)} approach is utilized.  The methods for wastewater bacteriological tests include:  multiple-tube fermentation technique, membrane filtration and quanti-tray testing. 
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bacteriological Analysis}\index{Bacteriological Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Involves bacteriological testing of the wastewater effluent and the surface water impacted by the wastewater discharge
	
	\item Conducted in-order to:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Meet the requirements of a wastewater discharge permit
			\item Monitor the pathogen impact of treated wastewater discharge
			\item Assess the level of contamination of a public body of water
			\item Bacteriological tests involves detection and quantification of one or more of the following bacteria:  total coliforms, fecal coliforms, \textit{E. Coli}, and \textit{Enterococci}. 
\begin{center}

Wastewater Bacteria
\end{center}
	
	\item  In wastewater, fecal coliforms originate in the intestines of warm-blooded animals.  Aerobic bacteria including coliforms partake in the metabolization of the organic matter as part of the secondary treatment process
\item Fecal coliforms are seldom pathogenic under normal circumstances and are easily cultured, their presence indicates the potential presence of pathogens

The reason why these bacteria such as coliforms and enterococcus are used:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item It is not practical to detect and quantify all pathogens associated with wastewater
			\item These bacteria originate from feces and indicate fecal contamination and thus serve as an indicator organisms for pathogens of wastewater origin
			\item They are also:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item abundant
					\item potentially less harmful, and
					\item easy to detect
				\end{itemize}
			\item \textit{E. coli} has been shown to be a better predictor of the potential for impacts to human health and therefore many newer wastewater discharge permits require \textit{E. Coli} testing in lieu of fecal coliform testing requirements.
		\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textit{Bacteriological Sampling}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Always collected as a grab
\item A clean, sterile borosilicate glass or plastic bottle containing sodium thiosulfate is used. Sodium thiosulfate is added to remove residual chlorine which will kill coliforms during transit. If the sample is not preserved or maintained under proper conditions until the test is conducted in the laboratory, the test would provide erroneous results
\item Samples must be refrigerated if they cannot be analyzed within 1 hour of collection
\item Samples must be handled with care to prevent contamination and adverse conditions such as prolonged exposure to direct sunlight
\item Maximum holding time for state or federal permit reporting purposes is 6 hours
\end{itemize}  


\textbf{\textit{Bacteriological Testing Methods}}
The methods for wastewater bacteriological tests include:  multiple-tube fermentation (MTF) technique, membrane filtration (MF) and quanti-tray testing.  When using the MTF and MF methods, it is not possible to exactly quantify the number of bacteria present, a statistical based - Most Probable Number (MPN) approach is utilized\\

\textbf{The Multiple-Tube Fermentation (MTF) technique}

This involves adding three volumes – 10 ml, 1 ml and 0.1 ml of the sample, each to a set of five tubes containing Lauryl Tryptose broth and an inverted tube (Durham tube), followed by incubating the tubes at  for a specified time.  The Lauryl Tryptose broth produces color and/or turbidity change due to the growth of the target bacteria and the inverted tube collects the gas produced by the bacterial respiration.  At the end of the process, the number of tubes showing bacterial growth are counted for each volume of sample and using this information the concentrations of organisms in the original sample are established using Statistical Tables.  The test is conducted in three parts – presumptive, confirmative and completed.  A schematic of the MTF used for quantifying total coliforms and fecal coliforms is provided below.\\

\newpage

\textbf{The Membrane Filtration (MF) method}
This is a faster way to estimate bacterial populations in water.  In this method, an appropriate sample volume is passed through a membrane filter with a pore size small enough (0.45 micron) to retain the bacteria present. The filter is placed on an absorbent pad (in a petri dish) saturated with a culture medium that is selective for coliform growth. The petri dish containing the filter and pad is incubated, upside down, for 24 hours at the appropriate temperature. After incubation, the colonies that have grown are identified and counted using a low power microscope. A MUG medium is used for E- Coli.  If E. Coli is present, it will make the MUG fluorescent when viewed in UV light.

\subsubsection{Quanti-trays tests}\index{Quanti-trays tests}

This test used for the detection and quantification of specific microorganisms is being used increasingly mainly because it is a quicker test than the MTF.  Colilert and Enterolert are the quanti tray based tests for E. Coli and Enterococcus.  This method involve the use of specific enzymes and overcomes the drawbacks of the MTF which include false positives and negatives due to the more generic nature of the media used

\subsection{Specific Gravity}\index{Specific Gravity}				
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Specific gravity is a term to express the weight of a solution with respect to that of water
				\item Water weighs 1 kg/L or 8.34 lbs/gallon or 62.4 lbs/ft$^3$
				\item A solution with a specific gravity of 1.2 will weigh 1.2 times the same volume of water.  1 L of that solution will weigh ( 1.2 kg )/L  or  ( 1.2*8.34=10lbs )/gallon.
				\item Typically wastewater and the associated unthickened sludge, for all practical purposes is assumed to have a specific gravity of 1 - implying 8.34 lbs/gallon.
				\item Specific gravity is typically used for calculations related to chemicals used in wastewater treatment.
