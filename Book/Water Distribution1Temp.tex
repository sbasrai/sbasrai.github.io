\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item The basic function of a water distribution system is to transport the water from the treatment facility to the customer.
\item In addition, distribution systems may also provide:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Storage 
\item Provide flow and pressure adequate for fire protection
\item Provide a point to sample water to ensure the end user is being provided with water that is safe and meets the regulatory requirements.
\end{enumerate}
\item As the volume of water necessary to fight fires is much greater than domestic and commercial water demand in most communities, the size of water mains, pump station capacity, and storage reservoir volume is determined by fire suppression needs.
\item Distribution systems should provide \textbf{adequate} and \textbf{reliable} water to the customer. 
\item Adequate means:
\begin{itemize}
\item Providing all the water the customer needs at a pressure not less than 20 psi. 
\item Water provided meets the customer's needs for quality.
\end{itemize}
\item Reliable means:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reliable means that customers can expect to obtain all the water they need, anytime they need it. In other words, they can expect that there will be water at the tap. 
\end{itemize}
\item As part of being adequate and reliable, the system must be operated in a way so that the quality of the water does not deteriorate between the treatment facility and the customer.
\item In most communities it is expected that adequate flow, pressure, and storage volume is available for fire prevention
\item The scope of this text is to describe the details of the piped distribution system.
\item Basic components of the piped distribution system includes: pipes, valves, fire hydrants, service connections, and reservoirs. Piped systems may also have pumping stations which are discussed in another Module. 
\item Per Title 22 Regulations, the minimum operating pressure in the water main at the user service line connection should be 20 psi at all times.
\item Characteristics of and ideal distribution system:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sized appropriately to accommodate system flows including fire flows.
\item Minimally impact water quality
\item Provide water at appropriate line pressures.
\item Built with components that are durable and corrosion resistant.
\end{itemize}
\item Primary components of the distribution system include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pipelines. which include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transmission Mains
\item Distribution Mains
\item Service Laterals
\end{itemize}
\item Facilities
\begin{itemize}
\item Storage Structures
\item Pump Stations
\item Pressure Reducing Stations
\end{itemize}
\item Appurtenances
\begin{itemize}
\item Valves
\item Angle Joints
\item Fire Hydrants
\item Meters
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\section{Pipelines}\index{Pipelines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pipelines are arteries and veins of a water distribution system. 
\item They are in a variety of lengths and sizes and deliver water throughout a wide range of areas.
\item The friction between the inside surface of the pipe and the water flowing through it, provides a resistance to the flow.  This resistance depletes the energy of the flowing water,  and is therefore important to ensure the pipe inside surface is smooth.
\item Besides the pipe, other components of the water distribution system including fittings, bends, valves, expansion joints and any change in direction can also create friction that causes energy/pressure loss.
\item \textbf{"C" factor} \index{Pipelines!C factor} is a measured value which quantifies the smoothness of the interior of a pipe. For most pipe materials C ranges from 60 - 150. A high C value implies less friction or a smoother pipe, greater water carrying capacity, and the smaller the friction or energy losses from water flowing in the pipe. A CPVC pipe has a C factor value of 150 whereas the C factor of a worn/pitted cast iron pipe would be about 60-80.
\item The pipes that carry water from, the treatment plant or the source in the absence of a treatment facility, to the consumer are often categorized from largest to smallest: transmission mains (or trunk), distribution mains, and service lines.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Transmission Mains}\index{Transmission mains}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transmission mains are large diameter pipes, carrying large volumes of water to the distribution system. 
\item Not all water suppliers have transmission mains of this size and some may not travel long distances. 
\item Typically there are no service connections to
customers off transmission mains unless they are smaller in size and are located within a distribution system.
\item Transmission mains are commonly welded steel and ductile iron pipe.
\item All newly installed water mains shall comply with the materials and installation standards of the American Water Works Association (AWWA).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Distribution Mains}\index{Distribution mains}
\begin{itemize}
\item California Code of Regulations require water mains to have a nominal diameter of at least four-inches.  Typical Distribution mains range in size from 6
inches up to 24 inches in diameter. 
\item Unlike transmission mains, distribution mains have customer services connected to them. 
\item Distribution mains are most commonly ductile iron pipe. However, polyvinyl chloride is also extensively used. Asbestos cement pipe is found only in older water systems.

\item Table ~\ref{table:TypesofDistributionSystems} summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the distribution mains:
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Service Lines}\index{Service lines}
\begin{itemize}
\item A service lateral is the pipe that provides water from the water main in the street to a home or business. 
\item For residences this pipe is usually 1 inch in size and runs from the water main into the home where the water meter is installed. 
\item Service lateral is typically connected to the main line through a brass plug valve called a corporation stop \index{Corporation stop}. 
\item A curb stop \index{Curb stop} is a brass plug valve installed at the water meter inside the valve box.  The curb stop is used to shut off the water flow to the user.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Distribution Network Configuration} \index{Distribution network}
\begin{itemize}
\item Distribution network is a system of pipes providing the appropriate quality and quantity of water to a community. 
\item The network construction and layout have to be carefully prepared in order to guarantee enough pressure and ensure hygienically safe water. 
\item Once constructed, maintenance – including repair, leakage control, preventing recontamination, etc. and the operation of pumping stations were gravity pressure is not enough – has to be ensured.
\end{itemize}

The main distribution system network design include:\\
\vspace{1cm}
    \textbf{Dead-end or Tree Distribution System}\index{Distribution network!Dead-end or tree type}\\

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[scale=0.47]{DeadEndTreeDistributionSystem}\\
    \end{center}    
    \end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this type of water distribution system, one main pipeline runs through the center of the community or building, and the sub-mains branch lines off from both sides. The sub-main lines are  divided into several branch lines for service connection to a particular house.\\
\item Advantages:
      \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
        \item Pipe laying is simple and easy.
        \item Fewer cut-off valves are required - lower O\&M costs.
        \item Maintenance done without disrupting flow
      \end{itemize}
\item Disadvantages:
		\begin{itemize}
		        \item Does not maintain satisfactory pressure in high-rise buildings.
        \item As one pipe provides the water to the entire community or building which is quite risky.
        \item High head loss, requires larger diameter piping
        \item System discharge capacity is limited.
        \item A large number of scour valves are required at the dead ends, which need to be opened periodically for the removal of stale water and sediment
        \item Dead-ends can cause water quality problems and require frequent flushing.
		\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ring Distribution System} \index{Distribution network!Ring type}\\
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{RingDistributionSystem}\\
    \end{center}    
    \end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this network, the supply main forms a ring around the distribution area.
\item The branches are connected cross-wise to the mains and also to each other.
\item This system is most reliable for a town with well-planned streets and roads.
\item Advantages:\\
\begin{itemize}
        \item Discharge rate is high, low head losses.
        \item Maintenance can be done without disrupting flow.
        \item No endpoints, minimal stagnation.
\end{itemize}
\item Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
        \item The length of pipe laying is more which ultimately leads to higher cost.
        \item Several valves are required to control the flow and discharge of water.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1cm}
\textbf{Grid Iron Distribution System}\index{Distribution network!Grid iron type}\\
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{GridIronDistributionSystem}\\
     \end{center}
     \end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Main supply lines run through the center, and sub mains branch off in perpendicular directions. 
\item The branch interconnects the sub-mains. All types of pipes are interconnected - no dead ends.
\item Water can reach any given point from many directions, which allows more flexible operation, particularly for repairs.
\item  It is the most widely used configuration in large municipalities. 
\item Advantages:\\
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Minimal stagnation or sediment deposit.
        \item Water is available at every point with minimum loss of head.
        \item Water is delivered with adequate pressure for firefighting.
        \item During repair, few houses are affected.
      \end{itemize}
\item Disadvantages:\\
       \begin{itemize}
        \item In this system, more cut-off valves are required.
        \item This system requires longer pipe lengths with larger diameters.
        \item The analysis of discharge, pressure, and velocity in the pipes is difficult and cumbersome.
      \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

\section{Pipeline Protection} \index{Pipelines! Protection}
Following measures are taken to ensure water distribution pipes are properly installed and protected to reduce risks to prevent contamination of the pipeline contents, protect public health and minimize disruption and costs associated with pipeline failures. 

\subsection{Piping Material Selection}\index{Pipelines! Piping material}
\begin{itemize}
\item The attributes for good pipe materials include:
\begin{itemize}
\item It should have adequate structural strength.

\item Impervious, corrosion-resistant, durable and long, lasting.

\item Cost-effective.

\item Resistance to abrasion.

\item Light weight so that easy to transport and handle.

\item Easy to join, flexible in design, easy to repair and maintain.

\item Environmentally friendly.
\item Ease of locating piping without excavation - pipes with electrical conductive material may be detected using electromagnetic metal detectors whereas pipes made from non-conductive material maybe detected by inducing a signal into the pipe from a valve or hydrant that may be picked up by an above-ground sensor.
\end{itemize}
\item Water distribution pipes material of construction include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Cast iron pipes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cast iron is the iron made in a foundry via casting - a process that involves melting metal and pouring it into a mold.  It is essentially iron with some carbon in it.  
\item Cast iron typically refers to gray cast iron.  
\item Ductile iron is a type of cast iron but is endowed with higher yield and tensile strength and ductility by the presence of elements including silicon, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, and/or copper.
\item Cast iron pipes attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stable and well suited for high water pressure.
\item  Heavy, which makes them unsuitable for inaccessible places due to transportation problems. 
\item Due to their weight they generally come in short lengths increasing costs for layout and jointing. 
\item Although durable, these pipes are brittle and have a short lifetime. They are subject to cracks and bending from exerted environmental and heavy-traffic pressure, and are susceptible to damage in freezing temperatures caused by expanding ice in the water mains.  
\end{itemize}
\item Ductile iron pipe attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ductile iron pipes are stronger, more durable, and less brittle. 
\item These pipes have more flexibility and are resistant to shocks and vibrations. 
\item Handle freezing temperatures better than cast-iron pipes.
\item Since cast and ductile iron pipes are susceptible to corrosion, a coating is applied to the outside and inside is lined with cement mortar to prevent tuberculation.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Steel pipes}\index{Pipelines! Piping material!Steel}
\begin{itemize}
\item Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon.
\item Steel pipes are comparatively expensive, but they are the strongest and most durable of all water supply pipes. 
\item Steel pipes by the virtue of its strength and being lighter than cast-iron pipes, it is an ideal material choice where large diameters pipes are required.
\item They can withstand high water pressure, come in convenient (longer) lengths than most other pipes and thus incur lower installation/transportation costs.
\item They can also be easily welded and are flexible to some extent can be laid on curves.
\item These pipes offer excellent resistance to internal pressure and pressure surges but are susceptible to atmospheric temperature changes which can cause the pipes to buckle.
\item Steel pipes are often provided with an internal asphalt coating to protect against corrosion.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Galvanized pipes} \index{Pipelines! Piping material!Galvanized}
\begin{itemize}
\item Galvanized steel is made from steel that has been coated with a layer of zinc to protect it from rust and corrosion, while galvanized iron is made from iron that has been coated with a layer of zinc.  
\item The use of galvanized steel or iron as a conveyor for drinking water is problematic where water flow is slow or static for periods of time because it causes rust from internal corrosion. 
\item These pipes may also give an unpalatable taste and smell to the water conveyed under corrosive conditions
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Asbestos cement (AC) or Transite pipes} \index{Pipelines! Piping material!Asbestos cement (AC) or Transite}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the early 1900s, asbestos cement pipe was first developed by reinforcing concrete with asbestos.
\item Asbestos gave the pipes increased strength, so they could operate under higher pressures. 
\item These pipes were affordable, durable and easy to handle.
\item In the early 1980s, the EPA banned use of all asbestos-related products.
\item Although these asbestos-lined pipes were discontinued, existing AC pipes were not replaced. 
\item Currently, AC pipes account for over 600,000 miles of the United States and Canada’s water distribution pipes.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Concrete pipes} \index{Pipelines! Piping material!Concrete}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reinforced Concrete Pipe (RCP) is made from concrete reinforced with steel
\item RCP pipes can be used up to the head of 60 in and for higher head pre-stressed concrete can be used.
\item There are pipes that are most durable with usual life of about 75 years.
\item The pipes can be cast at site work and thus there is the reduction in transport charges.
\item Although the initial cost is high, overall maintenance cost is less.
\item Inside surface of the pipe can be made smooth and there is no danger of rusting.
\item Transportation and repairs are difficult.

\begin{itemize}
\item HDPE pipe is a popular choice for water mains because of its durability and non-corrosive qualities.
\item These pipes are highly flexible and resistant to fatigue — they can handle usual pressure and pressure from recurring surges which is common in any water distribution system.
\item HDPE pipes cope with high impact not only from traffic but also from soil movement, making these pipes suitable for earthquake-prone regions.
\item These pipes are invaluable for water mains due to the strong joints fused together with heat and pressure. The joint is stronger that the actual pipe and prevents zero water loss, an important aspect for any efficient water distribution system.
\item HDPE to have pipe walls that are 2½ times as  thick in order to provide equivalent pipe strength and safety factor. This adds significantly to the resources  consumed and the cost of the pipe and appurtenances.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes} \index{Pipelines! Piping material!PVC}
\begin{itemize}
\item PVC water pipe is made by extrusion of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride. \item PVC pipes used for water mains comply with the AWWA C-900 standard for PVC pipes. This distinguishes it from other PVC water pipe that has a thinner wall.
\item The material is lightweight and easy to install. 
\item One disadvantage to PVC pipe is installation in contaminated soils, where fuel oils, gasoline, and other organic compounds may permeate the pipe wall.

\subsection{Pipeline Joints and Couplings}  \index{Pipelines!Joints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Joints and couplings join individual pipes and to other appurtenances including valves, hydrants etc. together, creating a continuous flow path in the piping systems. 
\item These are designed to provide secure and leak-free connections, ensuring the efficient transfer of fluids or gases and pipe material specific.

\subsection{Basic Water Main Installation} \index{Water main installation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Trenching and trench preparation
\begin{itemize}
\item To prevent drinking water contamination from adjacent sewage and other water pipes, drinking water pipes must meet standards Meeting standards to ensure California Code of Regulations, Title 22,
Division 4, Chapter 16, Section 64572 establishes criteria for the separation of new water mains from non-potable pipelines. These standards include:
\begin{itemize}
\item New water mains and new supply lines shall not be installed in the same trench as and \textbf{shall be at least 10 feet horizontally from and one foot vertically above, any parallel pipeline} conveying untreated/treated sewage, disinfected secondary recycled water or hazardous fluids such as fuels, industrial wastes, and wastewater sludge.
\item New water mains and new supply lines shall be installed at \textbf{least 4 feet horizontally from, and one foot vertically above, any parallel pipeline conveying tertiary recycled water, and storm drainage.}
\item New water mains \textbf{shall not be installed within 100 horizontal feet of the nearest edge of any sanitary landfill, wastewater disposal pond, or hazardous waste disposal site, or within 25 horizontal feet of the nearest edge of any cesspool, septic tank, sewage leach field, seepage pit, underground hazardous material storage tank, or groundwater recharge project site.}
\end{itemize}
\item Water main installation begins with excavation which is expensive and dangerous.  Before excavation can begin, the project must be well planned and all safety elements must be considered.
\item All trenching and excavations related safety hazards needs to be mitigated and applicable  To protect the trench and workers from traffic.
\item After the trench is prepared, inspect the pipe for defects, damage, oil, dirt, grease, and/or foreign matter.
\item Any unsound material should be replaced and all foreign matter or dirt should be removed from the interior of the pipe before lowering into the trench.
\item Before lowering the pipe into the trench the trench bottom should be smooth and free of material like large stones or large dirt clods.
\end{itemize}
\item Pipe installation
\begin{itemize}
\item Lower the pipes, and other necessary equipment carefully into the trench.
\item Before connecting the pipe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Inspect the pipe ends to be sure that no dirt or foreign material is on the joint locations.
  \item Clean the pipe end around the entire circumference from the end spigot to 1 inch above the reference line.
  \item Once the pipe is cleaned, be careful during installation to ensure gravel does not enter into the line.
\item Bedding is a granular material placed in the bottom of a pipe trench to support the pipe. 
\item Types of bedding include pea gravel, sand, and select native soil material.
\item A lack of proper uniform support can lead to “beam” breakage \index{Beam breakage} of the pipe.
\end{itemize}
\item To prevent pipe joints from uncoupling due to thrust forces created in a pipeline where it changes direction, and other damage from internal pressure or water hammer, thrust blocks are used.
\item Thrust blocks are often made of concrete and steel reinforcement rods cast in place or large precast concrete blocks. 
\item It is important that thrust blocks rest against undisturbed soil with sufficient bearing area. 
\item There are standard engineering formulas to determine the thrust exerted within a pipeline and the size of thrust block necessary for a given type of soil.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
     \includegraphics[scale=1]{ThrustBlocks1}
     \caption{Thrust blocks} \index{Thrust blocks}
    \end{center}    
    \end{figure}
\item After the water main pipe and fittings have been installed in the trench, the excavation must be backfilled with suitable material.
\item Only clean sand or selected soil should be used for the first layer. The bedding around the pipe should be of uniform size and material. Allowing materials of various sizes such as large rocks could cause the pipe to fracture during settlement.
\item The first layer of backfill should be placed equally on both sides of the pipe, up to about the center of the pipe. This material should then be compacted, a process often called haunching.
\item Depending on the area and conditions, generally another layer of backfill is placed over the pipe and again compacted to protect and secure the pipe.
\item The trench needs refilled appropriately. The backfill material should be compacted at 12 inch intervals to minimize settlement.
\item Backfill practices vary depending on type of pipe, local soil conditions and regulatory requirements. Proper backfilling is very important:
\item Improper compaction could result in a lack of proper uniform pipe support which may lead to “beam” breakage of the pipe. 
\item Large backfill material will increase probability of main break
\item After the trench has been backfilled, the new main must be pressure tested to determine whether there are any leaks.
\item The top of the pipe should be buried not less than 1 foot below the frost line. In those locations where frost is not a factor, the depth of cover should be not less than 2-1/2 feet to prevent mechanical damage.
\end{itemize}
\item Pipe disinfection
\begin{itemize}
\item All new sections of water mains must be thoroughly disinfected per AWWA Standard C651-05.
\item Sections of pipes, fittings and valves and other items that will be not disinfected by the filled line must be pre-cleaned and disinfected.
\item To properly disinfect water mains, different methods can be applied. Due to the dangers of chlorine it is advised that the operator choose the best method that suits the facility's needs.
\item The pipe disinfection process involves use of chlorine disinfectant of a specified concentration and time followed by flushing and sampling for bacteriological quality.
\item One or more fire hydrants should be used for flushing so that a velocity of around $5 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}$ is obtained in the pipe.
\item This velocity should be maintained long enough to allow two or three complete changes of water and for the water to run visibly clean. - Gravel in the line is an indication of improper installation.
\item The highly chlorinated water will probably kill grass, so the flow should be carried to a disposal site through hoses.
\item In some cases, the water may need dechlorinated before it is released to a waterway.

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Water storage}\index{Water storage}
\begin{itemize}
\item Water  storage reservoir in a water distribution system allows for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Maintaining water supply pressure - typically maintained by the water level in the storage reservoir.
\item As water demand changes during the day, the water reservoir provides the buffer capacity to meet the demand during peak period.  Allows for leveling out the pumping demands by allowing the pumping system to fill the reservoir to a specific level after which the pumps are shut off, and water is drawn from the reservoir until the level drops to a predetermined point at which time the pumps restart.
\item Providing fire fighting demand which may account for as much as fifty percent of total storage. In addition, fire-fighting demands must be met during main line breaks, power outages, and maximum customer demands.
\item Providing a point to blend different water supplies.
\item Providing ability to supply water during power outages and during maintenance of transmission mains.
\item Providing the detention time for chlorine disinfection to meet the water quality requirements.
\end{enumerate}
\item There are four basic type of storage reservoirs: \index{Water storage!Types of reservoirs}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Underground reservoir
\item Ground level reservoir
\item Elevated reservoirs which include elevated tanks and standpipes
\item Hydropneumatic tanks which are tanks which contain 1/3 air and 2/3 water.  The air in the tank is compressed as the tank fills with water and the pressurized air pushes water out of the tank.
\end{enumerate}
\item Typical material of construction include welded and bolted steel and cast-in-place and pre-stressed concrete.  Some smaller tanks such as the hydropneumatic tank is made from fiberglass.
\item Newly-installed distribution reservoir or distribution reservoir that has been taken out of service for repair or inspection is required to be disinfected and sampled for bacteriological quality in accordance with the American Water Works Association Standard C652-02 \index{Disinfection!AWWA Standard!C652-02 Disinfection of distribution reservoir}. If the results of the bacteriological sampling are positive for coliform bacteria, the reservoir shall be re-sampled for bacteriological quality and the test results shall be submitted to the State Board for review and approval before the reservoir is placed into service.

\subsection{Air Valves}\index{Air valves}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item Air valves are an essential component of the water supply system
\item Air and vacuum formed in water mains may lead to serious operating problems and even some dramatic consequences. Air can enter piping systems in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Empty Pipelines:  Pipelines not in operations are occupied with air. Most of it is evacuated during startup, but some air pockets can remain in the system.
 
\item Dissolved air in water: Depending on the temperature and pressure, water can contain trapped or dissolved air. During fluid flow, it separates from the liquid and can become trapped at the system’s high points. Also, in pipelines conveying sewage, the liquid waste can undergo chemical reactions and evolve into gases that can get trapped in the wastewater system.
 
\item Mechanical equipment: Air can also get into the pipeline through mechanical systems like pumps, pipe joints, valves, etc. Leaks or faulty seals in these components.

\end{itemize}
\item Consequences of air and vacuum in pipelines include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced pumping efficiency: Air in pipelines can reduce the efficiency of the pumping system. The air trapped at the high points of the system blocks flow, increasing the pressure head and thus the energy required for flow to occur.
 
\item Pipeline corrosion: Depending on the pipeline's temperature, oxygen in the trapped air can be a powerful corrosive agent. The oxygen oxidizes the metal gradually, which leads to rusting, blockage, and structural failure of the pipe.
 
\item Faulty metering and instrumentation devices: Air pockets and vacuums can cause problems for flow measuring and control devices. They affect the ability of the devices to accurately measure and control the flow.
 
\item Air hammer: When a trapped air pocket is present in a pipe, pressure builds up around the blockage. The pressure of the water swirling around this blockage sends vibrations throughout the pipe. This vibration, known as an air hammer, can potentially damage the distribution system components.
 
\item Pipe failure: Vacuums can cause catastrophic failures in pipelines. If there is a substantial vacuum, the pipe can collapse inwards due to the pressure difference on both sides of the pipe's walls.
\end{itemize}
\item Table ~\ref{table:Airvalve} summarizes the properties and use of the commonly used distribution system air valves and Figure ~\ref{fig:Airvalve1} provides a schematic of the air valve applications.

\subsection{Backflow Prevention}\index{Backflow}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5em,parsep=-0.5em]
\item Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply.
\item A backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. 
\item Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. 
\item Back-siphonage:\index{Backflow!Back siphonage}
\begin{itemize}
\item This is when higher pressure fluids, gases, or suspended solids move to an area of lower pressure fluids. A significant drop of pressure in a water delivery system creates a similar suction, pulling possibly undesirable material into the system. The effect is similar to drinking water through a straw. 
\item This is an example of an indirect cross-connection.\index{Backflow!Indirect cross-connection}
\end{itemize}

\item Back-pressure: \index{Backflow!Back-pressure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Occurs when a fluid under a higher pressure from systems like boilers, heat exchanging equipment, power washing equipment, fire sprinklers, or pumps enter potable water piping. This is an example of a \colorbox{green}{direct cross-connection}, with undesirable material being pushed into the system.
\end{itemize}
\item To reduce the risk of contamination, a backflow preventer can be fitted. A backflow preventer is also important when potentially toxic chemicals are used, for instance for commercial/industrial descaling of boilers, or when chemical bleaches are used for residential power washing.
\item Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply. \index{Backflow!Backflow preventer}
\item Backflow preventers are categorized into three groupings: Assembly, Device or Method. 
\item Tables ~\ref{table:Backflow1} and ~\ref{table:Backflow2} summarize the properties and use of the commonly used backflow devices.

\item Fire fighting
\item  Flushing distribution systems
\item For other utilities, such as street cleaning and sewer cleaning

\item Hydrants can be categorized as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Wet barrel \index{Fire hydrants!Wet barrel}
\begin{itemize}
\item Have the operating valve in the nozzle section
of the hydrant and are operated by rotating the operating stem on each of the outlets.
\item These hydrants are used in warm climates where it rarely freezes.
\item Their main advantage is the ease of connecting a second fire truck. 
\item Each discharge port is independently valved.
\end{itemize}
\item Dry barrel \index{Fire hydrants!Dry barrel}
\begin{itemize}
\item These have the operating valve installed below
ground.
\item The hydrant is equipped with a special drain valve that allows the above ground portion to automatically drain when not in use. 
\item The dry barrel
hydrant is widely used in colder climates. 
\item Its main advantage is that it is less
likely to freeze and normally not loose water when hit by a vehicle.
\item The dry-barrel hydrant must always be opened completely and never partially as the partially opened hydrant will allow pressurized flow through the drain valve, which may wash away the soil from the area surrounding the base, or the partially open main valve may trap small stones or other debris between the valve seal and seat.
\end{itemize}
\item A flush hydrant sits flush with the
surface of the ground and is used in airports, on bridges, and other places where the exposure of the hydrants is more of a hazard than the difficulty of connecting to a ground-level hydrant.

\item Optimizing the chloramination process.
\item Reducing the water age by flushing routinely and deep cycling storage tanks.
\item Hard flushing or mechanically pigging the distribution system, and conducting valve maintenance.
\item Replacing aging infrastructure as tuberculation in older pipes would allow biofilm accumulation.
\item Managing disinfectants in source waters containing chlorine and other sources that contain chloramines by blending.
\item Regular monitoring of the system for nitrification.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{System Flushing Program} \index{System flushing program}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each public water system should flush the water distribution system as necessary to reduce stagnant water and sediment build-up.
\item Biofilm or slime growth along with sediment deposits in the distribution pipes increases the chlorine demand and also negatively affect the water quality.
\item Flushing improves the water quality and also the carrying capacity of the pipes.
\item Flushing is normally practiced after receiving water quality complaints or preemptively during spring to prevent the rapid growth of biofilm during summer.
\item Advance planning elements include: minimizing inconvenience to customers and traffic impacts, public notifications, identifying sections of mains to be flushed and required valving and resource allocations.
\item Unidirectional flushing - where the flushing start point is at or near the source of supply and working outward into the distribution system is usually practiced.
\item A minimum flushing velocity of 2.5 ft/sec is recommended.
\item Hydrants are opened for atleast 5 to 10 minutes to stir up deposits.
\item Usually lines are flushed for atleast 30 minutes while ensuring the system pressure of the affected area does not drop below 20 psi.
\item Water samples may be taken at the beginning ad after flushing to determine its effectiveness and to identify need for additional flushing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Valves Operation and Maintenance} \index{Valves operation and maintenance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hydraulic problems associated with improper operation of valves include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cavitation \index{Cavitation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cavitation is a common occurrence in valves used in throttling or modulating service during the last few degrees of closure when the supply pressure is greater than about 100 psig. 
\item Cavitation is the sudden vaporization and violent condensation of a liquid downstream of the valve due to localized low pressure zones. 
\item When flow passes through a throttled valve, a localized low pressure zone forms immediately downstream of the valve. If the localized pressure falls below the vapor pressure of the fluid, the liquid vaporizes (boils) and forms a vapor pocket. As the vapor bubbles flow downstream, the pressure
recovers, and the bubbles violently implode causing a popping or rumbling sound similar to tumbling rocks in a pipe. 
\item The sound of cavitation in a pipeline is unmistakable. 
\item Cavitation can quickly destroy valve internals and even erode through pipe walls.
\item The condensation of the bubbles not only produces a ringing sound, but also creates localized stresses in the pipe walls and valve body that can cause severe pitting.
\item 
\item Cavitation may be prevented by ensuring selection of right size, type and location of the valve.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\item Water Hammer \index{Water hammer}
\begin{itemize}
\item Water hammer is the result of a pressure surge, or high-pressure shockwave that propagates through a piping system when a fluid in motion is forced to change direction or stop abruptly. 
\item This shockwave is typically characterized by a marked banging or knocking sound on the pipes immediately after a shutoff.
\item Water hammer can occur when an open valve suddenly closes, causing the water to slam into it, or when a pump suddenly shuts down and the flow reverses direction back to the pump. 
\item Since water is incompressible, the impact of the water results in a shock wave that propagates at the speed of sound between the valve and the next elbow in the piping system or within the column of water after the valve.
\item Water hammer, like cavitation, has the potential to cause catastrophic destruction to the distribution system piping.
\item Selecting the correct valve and lengthening the valve closure duration help mitigate water hammer occurrence.
\item Additionally, installation of air relief valves, air chambers - short segment of pipe with an an empty/air filled chamber that cushions shock waves, and water hammer arrestors - comprised of springs and air bladders which operate similarly to air chambers to reduce shock waves downstream of quick closing valves.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Valves must be maintained in working order.  This necessitates that valves be “exercised” on a routine basis and visually inspected for leaks on a regular basis.
\item Valve information including the following should be readily available:
\begin{itemize}
\item System map showing valve locations and system isolation points
\item Information on valve sizing, direction to open the valve, number of turns, model type and installation date
\end{itemize}
\item Adequate inventory of valves and its replaceable parts need to be maintained to ensure availability .
\item Detailed records of valve inspections and maintenance activities including inspection logs and service requests must be maintained.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distribution System Map} \index{Distribution system map}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each water system should maintain an accurate map of the distribution system piping and valves. 
\item The map should be sufficiently detailed to enable maintenance personnel to promptly locate facilities for repair or operational purposes.
\item All valves and pipes are shown on the system's "as built" plans.  They are updated as repairs are made.  In addition, the fixed facilities and structures are shown on the map.
\item Comprehensive \index{Distribution system map!Comprehensive map} and plat maps are typically used.
\item A comprehensive map provides an overall view of the entire distribution system.
\item A plat map \index{Distribution system map!Plat map} shows property boundaries and includes roads and location of utilities such as gas lines, access by water and sewer lines, as well as the location of buildings and other infrastructure on the property.\index{Plat map}
\item A map scale which is distance on the map and distance on the ground (actual), allows for showing locations and distances accurately on a sheet of paper of convenient size. \index{Map scale}
\item A map scale is provided on the map as a fraction or a ratio-1/10,000 or 1:10,000. These "representative fraction" scales mean that one unit of measurement on the map 1 inch or 1 centimeter represents 10,000 of the same units on the ground.
\item The scale used will be dependent on the size of system and the size of the map.  A commonly used scale for maps used for utilities is 1:600 - 1-inch on the map represents 600 inches or 50 feet (600 feet * 12inches/1 feet) on the ground.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distribution System Record keeping} \index{Distribution system record-keeping}
The minimum record keeping requirements include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Date, time and cause of any system pressure loss.
\item Corrective action taken in response to system pressure loss.
\item Distribution system repairs and maintenance: date, location and reason for repairs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Water Usage Records} \index{Water usage records}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each public water system should have production meters and should maintain records on water usage throughout the year. These records are kept for future information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Storage Tank Maintenance} \index{Storage tank maintenance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Water storage tanks should be inspected on a regular basis to ensure that the structure is in satisfactory condition and properly secured. 
\item Records should be maintained of these inspections.  
\item Access hatches should be locked and all openings to the tank should be properly screened.  \item Roofs should not allow entry of contaminants.
\item The storage tank is visually inspected weekly.  A detailed inspection is done on the tank every four (4) months.  
\item Applying protective coating - painting/coating, the internal and external walls of the tank needs to be conducted periodically.
\item Several tank coating related considerations and precautions include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Selecting the right paint - paints containing lead, PCBs, trichloroethylene etc. should be avoided.
\item  Ensuring appropriate surface preparation and adequate coatings drying times are provided.
\end{itemize}
\item Periodic, visual inspections and detailed cleaning and internal inspections are required. 

\item Records of the inspections are kept and any problems noted.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lead and Copper Sampling}\index{Sampling!Lead and copper sampling}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Samples are collected at customer's tap usually by the customer.
\item Sample needs to be a first draw sample - not allowing the water to run and NOT flushing out the service line.
\item Sample is collected early in the morning - no water to be used for a minimum of six hours before a sample is collected, no flushing and no opening a faucet.
\item Samples are not be be collected from unoccupied home where water has not been used for over 24 hours.
\item Action level for lead is 0.015 mg/L and copper is 1.30 mg/L
\item Action level means entailing either service line replacement program or changing water quality parameters, or adding chemicals such as polyphosphate to the water to reduce its corrosion potential.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Computer Based Controls and Monitoring} \index{Computer based controls and monitoring}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SCADA \index{SCADA}
\begin{itemize}
\item SCADA - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition is a  useful and now widely used  computer based control system
\item Distribution system components and operational parameters including - pressures, flows, meters, pump speed, wetwell levels, valve positions etc. can be monitored and controlled onsite or from a central location using SCADA.
\item SCADA allows for monitoring system operations to identify excursions of operating equipment from normal operating conditions/ranges and help predict/identify maintenance, repair and replacement requirements.
\end{itemize}
\item Automated Meter Reading 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Automated Meter Reading (AMR) is the communication technology water utilities use to automatically collect water consumption and status data from water meters. 
\item After collection, the meter data is transferred to a database where utilities can monitor and analyze usage, troubleshoot issues and bill customers based on actual consumption, rather than predictions that were often required with bi-monthly or quarterly manual reads.
\end{itemize}
\item Advanced Metering Infrastructure 
\begin{itemize}
\item Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is an integrated system of water meters, communication networks and data management systems that enables two-way communication between meter endpoints and utilities.  
\item The utility can use the data to improve operational efficiencies and sustainability by effectively monitoring water usage and system efficiency, detecting malfunctions and recognizing irregularities.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Corrosion Control} \index{Corrosion control}
\begin{itemize}
\item Metallic elements of the water distribution system, including pipes and fittings, is subject to corrosion where the metal is converted to its salt or oxide.
\item Corrosion in the water distribution system leads to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced mechanical strength leading to a loss in service life and piping failures - leaks and ruptures.
\item Leaching of toxic metals such as lead and copper into the drinking water
\item Formation and deposition of corrosion by-products in pipes made from material which include iron, leading to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Desposition of corrosion products on the inside surface of the pipe - \textbf{Tuberculation}  \index{Tuberculation} increase the roughness of the pipe, increasing the resistance to water thereby decreasing the water carrying capacity of the pipe and increasing the pumping cost.
\begin{figure}[h]

			      		\includegraphics[scale=0.07]{Tuberculation.jpg}\\
			      		\caption{Tuberculation}
			      	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\item  Consumer complaints of reddish or reddish-brown water and staining of plumbing fixtures due to the presence of iron oxides.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item Corrosion can happen from the outside of the pipe and also from the inside.
\item Corrosion from the outside occurs because of either \textbf{Galvanic Corrosion} \index{Corrosion!Galvanic corrosion} resulting from and electric current flowing between two dissimilar metals which are in direct contact or indirect contact through a conductive environment such as moist soil or due to \textbf{Chemical Corrosion} due to corrosive soil.
\begin{figure}[H]
			      	\begin{center}
			      		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ExternalCorrosion.jpg}\\
			      		\caption{External corrosion}
			      	\end{center}
\end{figure} 
\item Corrosion from the inside occurs because of:


\begin{itemize}
\item Water quality parameters which promote corrosion - low pH (acidic water, less than 7.0, but typically in the range of 4.0 to 6.5), low carbonate alkalinity, high oxygen content, high total dissolved solids, and/or high chloride or sulfides
\item Biofilm/slime formed on the inside surface of the pipe by bacteria creates an oxygen depleted environment under the biofilm next to the pipe surface, which in turn leads to the growth of specific types of bacteria that produce by-products corrosive to metals.
\end{itemize}

\item Corrosion control is critical to ensure integrity of the distribution system.
\item Corrosion rates are affected by the quality of water and system components design.
\item Regular inspections and observations provide indications of corrosion activity.
\item Corrosion coupons \index{Corrosion!Corrosion coupons} placed in the system provide quantitative measurement of corrosion.  Coupons are small pieces of the same type of metal as the piping which are inserted into pipes at various locations in the distribution system and are left in place for a period of time after which the amount of metal lost from the coupon due to corrosion can be determined.

			      		\textit{Figure shows how a corrosion coupon is inserted using a transparent pipe}
			      	\end{center}
\end{figure} 
\item Other maintenance and operation elements to control corrosion include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ensuring integrity of internal and external coatings of pipes and storage tanks
\item Dosing adequate quantities of corrosion inhibitors
\item Protecting the piping from external galvanic corrosion by the installation and proper operation of cathodic protection systems.  A cathodic protection system \index{Corrosion!Cathodic protection} protects a steel pipe from galvanic corrosion by electrically connecting the pipe to a replaceable, highly active metal - anode, which looses its ions and keeps the less active steel pipe from corroding.
