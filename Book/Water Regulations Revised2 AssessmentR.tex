% \hline 
% viii.  This rule is anticipated to propose treatment techniques to   improve control of microbial pathogens, specifically including Cryptosporidium. The techniques are   to consider the risks of treatment for Cryptospodrium   versus the potential for generation of   disinfection byproducts. \\
% \hline 
% ix.  The purpose of this rule is to assess information and research   that was not fully considered in the Stage 1 process or that has only been   available since 1998, as it relates to microbial standards to protect public   health.                                                        \\
