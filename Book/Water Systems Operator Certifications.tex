\section{Operator certification background}\index{Operator certification background}
\begin{itemize}
\item Federal law requires operators at water treatment plants for drinking water, wastewater, and recycled water, as well as those involved in the distribution of drinking water, to be State certified.  

\item For drinking water, California's State Water Resources Control Board's (SWRCB's) Drinking Water Operator Certification Program (DWOPCP) under its Drinking Water Operator Certification Program (DWOCP), is responsible for the testing and certification of water treatment and water distribution operators throughout the state of California.

\item For wastewater, the SWRCB's Wastewater Operator Certification program (WWOCP) administers Wastewater Treatment Plant Certification examinations, certifications (Grades I to V), and certification renewals.

\item The CA-NV AWWA currently offers voluntary Advanced Water Treatment Operator (AWTO) certifications for water and wastewater operators to meet the high demand for highly skilled and certified advanced water treatment operators.

\end{itemize}

\section{Operational activities}\index{Operator!Operational activities}
California laws stipulate that water systems shall utilize only certified operators to make decisions addressing the following operational activities:\\
\subsection{Drinking water treatment:}\index{Operator!Operational activities!Treatment}
Water treatment operators work in water treatment plants where water from wells, rivers, streams, and reservoirs is treated and distributed to customers. Water treatment plant operators typically do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add chemicals, such as ammonia, chlorine, or lime, to disinfect water or other liquids.
\item Inspect equipment on a regular basis.
\item Monitor operating conditions, meters, and gauges.
\item Collect and test water and sewage samples.
\item Record meter and gauge readings, and operational data.
\item Operate equipment to purify and clarify water, or to process or dispose of sewage.
\item Clean and maintain equipment, tanks, filter beds, and other work areas.
\item Stay current on environmental laws and regulations.
\item Ensure safety standards are met.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Water distribution:}\index{Operator!Operational activities!Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Water distribution operators are responsible for the safe and efficient operation of water pumps, valves, and other equipment. They monitor gauges and meters to ensure that water is being distributed in a timely manner and at appropriate pressures.

\item Water distribution operators may also be tasked with maintaining or repairing any equipment that breaks down during their shift. This could include anything from replacing parts on pumps to fixing leaks in pipes or hoses.
\item Water distribution operators typically do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Install, tap, re-line, disinfect, test and connect water mains and appurtenances.
\item Shutdown, repair, disinfect and test broken water mains.
\item Oversee the flushing, cleaning, and pigging of existing water mains.
\item Pull, reset, rehabilitate, disinfect and test domestic water wells.
\item Stand-by emergency response duties for after hours distribution system operational emergencies.
\item Drain, clean, disinfect, and maintain distribution reservoirs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Water systems shall utilize either certified distribution operators or treatment operators that have been trained to make decisions addressing the following operational activities:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Operate pumps and related flow and pressure control and storage facilities manually or by using a system control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.
\item Maintain and/or adjust system flow and pressure requirements, control flows to meet consumer demands.
\item Determine and control proper chemical dosage rates for wellhead disinfection and distribution residual maintenance.
\item Investigate water quality problems in the distribution system.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Wastewater treatment:}\index{Operator!Operational activities!Wastewater}
Wastewater operators typically do the following as part of their job responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Operate and maintain the wastewater treatment plant and collection systems.
\item Operate and adjust controls on treatment plant equipment and machinery, such as valves, pumps, and motors. 
\item Read and interpret meters and gauges.
\item Regulate plant effluent.
\item Monitor, repair, and maintain wastewater system lift stations; remove debris; disassemble and clean pumps; perform minor repairs when necessary. Locate problems and operate sewer cleaning equipment to clear blockages.
\item Performs routine maintenance and minor repairs on plant equipment, system equipment,
facilities, distribution system, and collection system.
\item Maintaining plant records and preparing monthly and quarterly reports.
\item Perform all aspects of sampling, monitoring, and testing required to maintain compliance with Federal, State, and Local regulations governing the wastewater treatment process, stormwater, and sludge management.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced treatment/water reuse:}\index{Operator!Operational activities!Advanced treatment/water reuse}
The Advanced Water Treatment Operators (AWTO) perform a full range of duties associated with operating and maintaining water treatment systems and equipment used for Advanced Water Treatment for water reuse.
AWTO typically do the following as part of their job responsibilities:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Operate, monitor, and maintain AWT processes, such as membrane systems and advanced oxidation.
\item AWTOs have an advanced understanding of technologies and regulations pertinent to the end uses of treated water; such as recycled water, potable water, and potable water reuse.
\item At the supervisor and management level, maintain regular communication with regulatory agencies and ensure permit compliance. 
\item Responsibility for preparing and submitting regulatory reports.
\end{itemize}

\item Continuing education are courses, classes or seminars that present “information related to the operation of a drinking water treatment facility and/or distribution system.”  Continuing education hours can be earned by attending water industry 
meetings, conferences, workshops, in-­house training, college courses, correspondence 
courses and internet classes.
