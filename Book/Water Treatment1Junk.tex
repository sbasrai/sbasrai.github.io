\section{Background}\index{Background}
\begin{itemize}
\item Purpose of water treatment is to provide safe drinking water that does not contain objectionable taste, odor or color and provide adequate quantities of water for domestic, commercial, industrial and fire protection needs.

\item Even though U.S. tap water supplies are considered to be among the safest in the world, water contamination can still occur. There are many possible sources of contamination, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sewage releases
\item Naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (for example, arsenic, radon, uranium)
\item Local land use practices (for example, fertilizers, pesticides, livestock, concentrated feeding operations)
\item Manufacturing processes (for example, heavy metals, cyanide)
\item Malfunctioning on-site wastewater treatment systems (for example, septic systems)
\item In addition, drinking water that is not properly treated or that travels through an improperly maintained distribution system (pipes) may also create conditions that increase risk of contamination.
\end{itemize}

\item Drinking water quality varies from place to place, depending on the condition of the source water from which it is drawn and the treatment it receives, but it must meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\colorbox{pink}{EPA}) regulations. Community water systems follow the rules set forth by the Safe Drinking Water Act (\colorbox{pink}{SDWA}).

\item The level of treatment and treatment processes used are primarily dependent on the quality - level of contamination of the source water.

\item Generally speaking surface waters contain more contaminants compared to groundwater as surface waters are more exposed to contamination from runoffs etc.  
\item Although groundwaters are succeptible to contamination from seepage and soil percolation, the sediment layers help filter water naturally. 

\item The quantity and quality of surface water supplies vary more than groundwater, particularly seasonally.

\item The purpose of water treatment is to condition, modify, or remove undesirable impurities and to provide water that is safe, palatable, and acceptable to users. Some regulations state that if the contaminants listed under the various regulations are found in excess of the Maximum Contaminant Levels (\colorbox{pink}{MCLs}), the water must be treated to reduce the levels. 

\item The primary objective of the Surface Water Treatment Rule (\colorbox{pink}{SWTR}) of the SWDA is to control microbiological contamination - specifically pathogenic bacteria and parasites, specifically \textit{Giardia lamblia} and \textit{Giardia lamblia}.

\item Groundwater from a well or spring which is influenced by surface water - Groundwater Under Direct Influence of Surface Water (\colorbox{pink}{GWUDI}) is subjected to the SWTR based treatment requirements, regardless of the actual presence of contamination. If they exceed secondary MCLs established by EPA and the state, the water may have to be treated. 

\item If we assume that the water source used to feed a typical water supply system is groundwater, which is usually the case in the U.S., a number of common groundwater problems may require water treatment. Among these other problems are: bacteriological contamination, hydrogen sulfide odors, hard water, corrosive water,and iron and manganese.

\item Many states enforce their own drinking water standards that are at least as protective as EPA’s national standards. The SDWA rules include guidelines for drinking water quality, water testing schedules, and water testing methods.

\item Private wells, which are not regulated by the EPA, supply drinking water to over 15 million homes. Well owners are responsible for keeping their water clean and safe.

\item When water system officials find an issue with the drinking water supply (for example, that it has become contaminated), a water advisory may be issued to help protect the public’s health.

\item The presence of certain contaminants in our water can lead to health issues, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may be especially at risk for illness.

\item All water produced by public water systems must be drinking water quality, even though only about 1\% of water produced is used for drinking and cooking.

\item Water may be treated differently in different communities depending on the quality of the source water that enters the treatment plant. The water that enters the treatment plant is most often either surface water or ground water. Surface water typically requires more treatment and filtration than ground water because lakes, rivers, and streams contain more sediment (sand, clay, silt, and other soil particles), germs, chemicals, and toxins than ground water.

\item Some water supplies may contain radionuclides (small radioactive particles), specific chemicals (such as nitrates), or toxins (such as those made by cyanobacteria). Specialized methods to control or remove these contaminants can also be part of water treatment.

Schematic of conventional water treatment:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Water is withdrawn from a lake, reservoir or river at the intake
\item It is screened to remove debris
\item Water then enters the flash mixing tank where coagulants and other chemicals are added
\item Then it is divided into the flocculation basin
\item After flocculation, the water enters the settling basins where solids are removed
\item Filtration then removes particles that are too small to settle by gravity
\item The water is disinfected using some form of chlorine
\item Other chemicals such as fluoride, phosphate corrosion inhibitors or pH adjustment chemicals may be added
\item After a minimum detention time, the water may be pumped to the distribution systems Other processes may occur, such as pre-oxidation or activated carbon treatment.
\end{enumerate}

\item There are many treatment approaches when it comes to treating a range of problems that can occur in groundwater. Many of these methods use a combination of technologies. When considering the appropriate approach, it is important to note that each site should be treated case by case. Since every site offers a different history, background, and unique landscape. 

\section{Categories of Treatment Methods}\index{Categories of Treatment Methods}
Typical treatment methods used can be categorized as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Biological\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Microbes based biological systems are used for nutrient and organic removals from drinking water
\item Typically the biological processes utilize the fixed biofilm - support medium on which the biomass is attached.
\item Some applications use suspended growth reactors where the biomass is suspended in the water being treated. 
\end{itemize}

\item Chemical\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Chemical oxidants are injected or mixed into groundwater to destroy contaminants upon contact. Chemical oxidants include oxygen gas, ozone, and other liquid chemicals.\\
\end{itemize}
\item Physical\\
Most common physical techniques are:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Sedimentation:  Involves gravity settling of settleable particles by gravitational force from the water.
\item Filtration involves removal of pollutants by physical processes including straining, adsorbtion and absorption.
\item Dissolved air flotation or Degasification:  Utilizes pressurized air to remove dissolved gases is the process of removing dissolved gases from the water.

\end{itemize}



\end{enumerate}

\section{Source Management}\index{Source Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item When options are available, source management implies effectively managing water sources, to ensure the intake of best possible quality of water from a regulatory compliance and treatment optimization perspective.
\item Examples of source management include:
\begin{itemize}
\item For systems using lake or reservoir sources, selecting the optimum depth from which to draw water depending on the water quality during that time of year or for other reasons (e.g. algal bloom,
storm upsets, etc).
\item Systems that have multiple sources may consider blending or alternating surface and ground
water sources to attain the best blended raw water for compliance. If blended prior to treatment, all water must be treated to surface water standards.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Surface Water Treatment Processes}\index{Surface Water Treatment Processes}
\subsection{Source Water Treatment}\index{Source Water Treatment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Source water treatment in reservoirs or lakes includes treatment to contain algae growth.
\item Algal bloom is a sudden large increase in algae caused by weather or by nutrients. 
\item Reasons for controlling algae:
\begin{itemize}
\item Taste and odor problems
\item Shortened filter runs
\item Changes in pH - increases during the day, decreases at night
\item When algae dies, causes depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO)
\item Organic loading which is DBP pre-cursor resulting in TTHMs.
\end{itemize}
\item Algaecide such as blue stone, copper sulfate (CuSO$_4$) is used to control algae. 
\item Action level for copper is 1.3 mg/L·	·

\item Copper sulfate dose is usually specified in terms of pounds/acre. 
\item 5.4 lbs/acre is common dosage - the rate of application is based on the surface area of the reservoir not the volume
\item For water with alkalinify of higher than 150 mg/L, citric acid has to be mixed with CuSO$_4$ for it to be effective
\item Methods for dosing CuSO$_4$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Application of copper sulfate:
\item Dragging burlap bags behind a boat. Rate of application is controlled by the speed at which boat is traveling. ·
\item Using a hopper mounted on a boat
\item Spraying solution from a boat
\item Aerial spraying 
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Screening}\index{Screening}
\begin{itemize}
\item River water (the source of water used in our discussion) frequently contains suspended and floating debris varying in size from small rags to logs. Screening is usually the first major step where by large and suspended debris in the source water including sticks, leaves etc. is removed from the water before it enters the plant. 
\item Removing these solids is primarily to prevent damage to downstream equipment including pumps, prevent deposition of this debris in open channels or pipes, or in treatment processes.
\item The most important criteria used in the selection of a particular screening system for are the screen opening size and flow rate. Other important criteria include costs related to operation and equipment, plant hydraulics, debris handling requirements, and operator qualifications and availability. 
\item Depending on the characteristics of the source water, variety of screening devices including trash rakes, bar screens and wire mesh screens may be used. Very small screens can be used to screen out elements including algae in the water.
\item Typical screening devices used include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Trash Screens (Rakes) - used to remove rough or large debris.  The bar spacing in Rakes range from 1.5 to 4 inches.
\item Traveling Water Screens (Bandscreens) - these are placed in a channel of flowing water to remove floating or suspended debris.

\subsection{Coagulation and Flocculation}\index{Coagulation and Flocculation}
\begin{itemize}
\item A significant amount of suspended particles in the raw water are too small to be filtered or settled out in the sedimentation basin.  These particles, termed as non-settleable solids include organic matter, silt, clay.
\item These particles impart turbidity and color to the water and may harbor pathogens and typically carry a negative electrostatic charge on its surface.  The like surface charge on these particles cause electrostatic repulsion (particles keep bouncing off one another) which makes these particles difficult to settle. 
\item Coagulation and flocculation are sequential processes both of which involve chemical addition.
\item For coagulation, either metal salt type coagulant - typically an aluminum salt such as alum or aluminum sulfate or an iron salt such as ferric or ferrous chloride or sulfate, polyaluminum chloride or a organic coagulant such as polyDADMAC or polyamine is used. The coagulant helps coalesce the non-settleable solids into larger particles.
\item Sodium aluminate is often used as an aide to alum coagulation particularly for cold water and during lime softening.
\item Coagulation is affected by changes in the water's pH, alkalinity, temperature, time, velocity and zeta potential.

\item The effectiveness of a coagulant is generally pH dependent. Water with a color will coagulate better at low pH (4.4-6) with alum.

\item Alkalinity is needed to provide anions, such as (OH) for forming insoluble compounds to precipitate them out. It could be naturally present in the water or needed to be added as hydroxides, carbonates, or bicarbonates.  Generally 1 part alum uses 0.5 parts alkalinity for proper coagulation.

\item The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction, and the more effective is the coagulation. Winter temperature will slow down the reaction rate

\item The coagulation process requires rapid mixing of the water upon the addition of the coagulant followed by a sufficient contact time prior to the flocculation step.
\item The flocculant which is added after the coagulation step is to make even larger, more compact and settleable - \colorbox{lime}{floc}, from the coagulated solids.
\item Flocculants are typically long chain organic compounds - polymers with charged end groups.  \colorbox{lime}{anionic polymers} have a negative end group whereas \colorbox{lime}{nonionic polymers} have balanced - positive and negative end groups.
\item For the floc formed to remain intact, the polymer is gently "folded in" with the coagulated solids.  The flocculation is done in a flocculator which have a detention time of 5 -30 minutes and the water is mixed with the polymer using slow moving paddles.
\item Coagulant aids - chemicals which aid in the coagulation process and strengthening the flow include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alakalinity enahncers - lime, Soda ash, caustic soda and sodium bicarbonate.
\item Weighting agents - calcimu carbonate and bentonite clay.  These are used in waters which are low in tubidity and high in color which under normal condition would have formed weak, slow settlling floc.
\item Activated sililca - sodium silicate activated by hypochlorous acid is often used as a coagulant aid with alum.
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}

\item These will usually be used in conjunction with a primary coagulant such as ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, or alum.

\item Determining the amount and type of coagulant used changes based on a variety of process conditions and quality of water. For example, a heavy rain will greatly impact the influent, or raw, water in a municipal treatment plant.

\item The jar test is a standard method in which various amounts of coagulant and flocculation times are tested on a raw water sample. There are multiple samples to test before implementation into a larger volume of the water treatment process.

\subsection{Clarification/Sedimentation}\index{Clarification/Sedimentation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clarification, or sedimentation, is the third step in conventional water treatment, after coagulation and flocculation and before filtration.
\item In the sedimentation basin the flocculated particles settle out under the influence of gravity.
\item In conventional sedimentation basins the solids drop out (settle) as the water slowly flows across the basin from the influent to effluent end.
\item Sedimentation basins are designed to create conditions in which the water flows very slowly through the basin, with minimal turbulence.
\item Conventional sedimentation basins are typically rectangular or cylindrical concrete or steel vessels which incorporate a horizontal flow of water.
\item To reduce the footprint of the conventional sedimentation basins, upflow-type clarifiers.
\item Synonyms:  primary treatment basin, primary clarifier, sedimentation basin, primaries, clarifier

	
		\item Primary treatment is after preliminary treatment and 				before secondary treatment
		\item Its two main objectives are: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Remove settleable solids
				\item Remove floatable solids
			\end{itemize}
		\item This is a physical process which relies on the physical 			properties - how heavy or light the suspended solids particles 		are to effect its separation
		\item Provides quiescent conditions for the influent 					wastewater for the heavier solids to settle and the lighter 			solids to float
		\item Removes settleable solids and floatables
		\item Settled solids are removed as sludge from the bottom of 			the clarifier
		\item Floatable solids including oil and grease are also 				removed, as scum from the surface\\
		\item The shape of the primary clarifier is either rectangular 		or circular
	
		\item Effective solids removal in the primary clarifiers will 			reduce the loading on the expensive secondary treatment 				process.
		\item The amount of solids removed during primary treatment 			may be enhanced by chemical addition - ferric or ferrous 				chloride as a coagulant and anionic polymer as the flocculant.  		This is called Chemically Enhanced Primary Treatment (CEPT).
\item \textbf{Typical Removal Rates:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \hspace{10mm} BOD removal – 25\% to 40\% and about 60\% with CEPT
\item \hspace{10mm} Suspended solids (SS) removal – 40\% to 60\% and about 75\% with CEPT
\item \hspace{10mm} Settleable Solids removal - $>$90\%
\end{itemize}

\section{Clarifier Zones}\index{Clarifier Zones}
				
\subsection{Inlet Zone}\index{Inlet Zone}		
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Inlet Zone is where the water enters the end 					of a rectangular tank, or the center of a circular 					or square tank.
					\item The Inlet Zone is designed to accomplish two 					objectives:
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item Reduce the velocity (dissipate 									energy in the incoming water)
							\item Distribute the flow evenly
						\end{enumerate}
					\item The inlet zone is equipped with a baffle.  					Inlet baffle reduces the velocity of the 							influent flow, prevent short circuiting which 							could cause solids being carried over to secondary 					treatment.  
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Circular tanks are equipped with a 								collar-type circular baffle that directs 								the water down as it enters the center of 								the tank.
							\item Rectangular tanks will have a plate 								baffle in front of the opening for the 									wastewater flow into the clarifier and 									another baffle just upstream - a 										perforated wall or a picket fence type 									baffle that spreads the water laterally 								across the inlet end of the tank.\\

\subsection{Settling Zone}\index{Settling Zone}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This is the largest portion of the tank where 					solids settle.
				\item The water velocity is reduced to 0.03-0.05 fps 					and the detention time is about 1.5 to 2 hours. 
				\item A clarifier is said to be short circuiting if 					the velocity of the water is greater in some sections 					than in others. The water passing through the higher 					velocity region will have a reduced detention time and 				settleable solids will carry through with this water 					as it goes over the weir.  Short circuiting is 							prevented by appropriately designing inlet baffles and weir plates (at the Outlet Zone).
			\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sludge Zone}\index{Sludge Zone}
			\begin{itemize} 
				\item Sludge zone is the bottom of the tank where the 					settled sludge collects and compacts.
				\item Sludge blanket depth should be measured and 						sludge should be removed at least every shift. A 						desirable blanket depth is typically established and 					the sludge pumping rate and regimen is established to 					maintain that desired sludge blanket level.
				\item Sludge rakes push the sludge to one end or the 					center of the tank so that it can be pumped out. 
				\item The rake drive is usually equipped with a torque 				indicator. A shear pin in the drive shaft will break 					to prevent damage to the gearbox or drive shaft. 
				\item Failure to remove sludge often enough will 						result in the sludge becoming septic releasing gas 						bubbles which hinders the sludge settling and also 						result in causing odor problems.
				\item The sludge from the primary clarifiers needs to 					be stabilized prior to its disposal.  The sludge 						(solids) from the primary clarifiers are mixed with 					the solids from the secondary treatment process and 					stabilized typically using a sludge digestion process. 
			\end{itemize}
\subsection{Skimming Zone}\index{Skimming Zone}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item The skimming zone is at the surface of the tank 					for scum removal
				\item Lighter solids and greases float to the surface 					of the clarifier as scum
				\item In Circular Clarifiers:  Floating matter is 						skimmed by a skimmer arm that is supported by the 						sludge rake and rotates with it around the tank. The 					floating matter is pushed over the beach plate by the 					wipers attached to the skimmer arm and into a scum box 				attached to the tank wall.\\
				\item In Rectangular Clarifiers:  The flights act as 							skimmers when the chain brings them to the surface and 				pushes the scum towards the scum troughs.  The scum 					trough may be designed to rotate (tip) periodically 					for the scum to flow in from the water surface.\\
							
				\item The scum collected from the primary clarifiers is sent 				to the digester for treatment along with the sludge 					removed.\\

									\includegraphics[scale=0.02]{Blank}\\
				\end{center}	

				\item The flights in the rectangular clarifier are supported 				at the top by two parallel rails running along the 						length of the clarifier.\\
				\item There are wear plates (strips) installed at the 						clarifer bottom and on top of the rails to prevent the 				flights from riding directly on those surfaces.  To 					reduce friction, the flights have a wearing shoe 						attached.  
				\item Both the wear strip and the wearing shoe 					are disposable items and are replaced at fixed 							intervals.\\

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Outlet Zone}\index{Outlet Zone}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item  This is the part of the clarifier where the 						settled water leaves to go to the secondary treatment 					processes.
				\item A channel called the effluent launder collects 					the effluent flow and directs it to the primary 						effluent piping. 
				\item Weirs are installed along the edge of the effluent launder channel to skim the water evenly off the surface of the tank. The most common type of effluent weir is a V-notch (or saw-tooth) weir.   A V-	notch weir is a plate that has notches, about 2-3 						inches deep, cut in it every 6-8 inches. If the weir is clean and level, it will remove water evenly all 					the way around the edge of the tank. This minimizes 					the upward velocities near the effluent launder and 					improves removal efficiencies. If the weir plate is not level or part of the weir becomes clogged with 				slime or debris, short-circuiting will result because 					more water will pass over the low side or the clean notches of the weir. Short-circuiting will cause poor 					settling and uneven sludge blanket buildup.
				\item In rectangular tanks the water leaves at the end 	opposite the influent.
												  
				\item In circular  tanks the water leaves at the edge of the tank.
				\item Also, in the circular clarifiers, an effluent baffle, just upstream of the weir, 					is installed to prevent floating solids from going 						over the weir.

\section{Sludge Pumping}\index{Sludge Pumping}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The sludge pumping from the clarifier must be adequate 			to prevent sludge from going septic. Septic sludges are much 			more difficult to thicken or de-water and cause odor issues. 
		\item Primary sludge normally averages 4-6\% solids. 
		Generally positive displacement pumps are used for primary 				sludge
		\item The pumping cycles must be designed to provide the 				thickest sludge possible.
		\item Excessive pumping or pumping without building solids to 			build up leads to pumping thinner (more water) sludge.

\subsubsection{Process Basics}\index{Process Basics}
\begin{itemize}
\item The SWTR requires the filtration of Surface water and ground water under the direct influence of surface water 
\item Slow sand filtration is one of a number of filtration technologies that can permit a water system to comply with the filtration requirements of the SWTR.
\item Filtration does not remove dissolved solids and by itelf is not effective for the removal of bacteria. Also, pre-treatment (example: coagulation/flocculation) and final disinfection are therefore needed. 
\item Conventional filtration is a four step treament process that consists of the treatment steps of coagualation, flocculation, sedimentation and rapid sand filtration. 
\item In filtration, solids are removed physically by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Straining – trapping particles, and 
\item Through adsorption.
\end{itemize}
\item Granular Bed and Pre-coat Filters are typically used for surface water treatment

\item Media in Granular Bed filter is comprised of one or a combination of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sand
\item Anthracite
\item Granular activated carbon
\end{itemize}
\item Pre-coat filters use a thin layer of very fine medium such as diatomaceous earth.  Precoat filtration is used to remove very small particulate matter, oil particles, and even bacteria from water. This method is practical only for relatively small quantities of water which contain low concentrations of contaminants.
\item Filters can also be classified as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravity – open to atmosphere
\item Pressure – utilize a pressure vessel to contain the media
\end{itemize}
\item Gravity filters can be operated at different hydraulic rates
\begin{itemize}
\item Slow filters
\item Rapid filters
\end{itemize}
\item Filters can also be classified as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Depth filtration – solids are removed within the granular material.  Example: Rapid granular bed filter
\item Cake filtration – solids are removed on the entering face of the granular material.  Example: Precoat
\end{itemize}

\item Rapid sand filtration is the most common type of filtration used in water treatment. Whereas slow sand filtration is usually a feasible alternative for SWTR compliance only for small water systems with relatively high quality source water.
\item Filter media in a rapid sand filter refers to the granular material used to remove particles from the filter influent. 
\item Typical filter media in a rapid sand filter include sand (of course), and sometimes a “cap” of coal or granular activated carbon (GAC) placed on top of the sand media layer. 
\item Filters with a sand and coal/carbon cap are referred to as dual media filters. Some rapid sand filters also contain a thin layer of garnet sand. This layer also tends to improve filter performance.  
\item Filters with a layer of garnet sand are referred to as mixed media filters.
\item In a slow sand filter there is a  layer - \colorbox{lime}{Schmutzdecke} that develops on the top and is made up of microrganisms that feed on and break down organic material that is trapped on the surface of the filter. If the source water naturally contain low levels of nutrients, initial nutrient addition may be needed to develop this layer.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Operation}\index{Operation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The removal mechanism in filtration involves straining – trapping larger particles and through adsorbtion where particles attach themselves to the filter media
\item Typical Filtration Rates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Slow Sand: 0.05 gpm/ft$^2$ - 3 feet sand
\item Rapid Sand: 2 gpm/ft$^2$ – 3 feet sand
\item Pressure filters: 3 gpm/ft$^2$
\item High Rate: 2-6 gpm/ft$^2$ – various media configurations
\end{itemize}

\item After a period of operation – filter cycle, the filter headloss increases because of the accumulation of the trapped solids.
\item Rapid filters are cleaned by backwashing using an upward, high-rate flow of water
\item Slow sand filters are cleaned by scrapping off the dirty layer from the surface.
\item The Schmutzdecke enhances the particulate removal.  As the Schmutzdecke develops, the filter performance – as measured by the turbidity typically improves as the filter run progresses.
\item Coagulation-flocculation is not required for cake filtration whereas chemical treatment is required for depth filtration.
\item Backwashing involves reversing the flow of water through the filter causing water to travel from the bottom of the filter to the top. 
\item Backwash is done at specific rates in order to most effectively remove the particulate material.  Backwashing process can be augmented by introducing low pressure air into the backwash line.
\item Backwash rates of 12-15 gpm/ft$^2$ or higher are common for sand, and rates for anthracite may range from 8 to 12 gpm/ft$^2$.
\item Wastewater used for the backwash is collected and removed from the filter.

\begin{itemize}
\item Potassium Permanganate Oxidation and Manganese Greensand
\begin{itemize}
\item Utilizes greensand – a natural mineral (glauconite) coated with manganese dioxide as the filter media to remove iron and magnesium.
\item The Greensand catalyzes the oxidation of the dissolved iron and manganese forming solid particles which are filtered out.
\item Potassium permanganate is commonly used as the oxidant.

\subsubsection{Granulated activated carbon filter}\index{Granulated activated carbon filter}
\begin{itemize}
\item Granulated activated carbon filter\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{minipage}{.6\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Granulated Activated Carbon (\colorbox{pink}{GAC}) filters have a layer of activated carbon on top of anthracite or sand.
\item Activated carbon adsorbs various contaminants, such as tastes and odor-causing organics, THMs, and synthetic organics. 
\item GAC is lighter than sand or anthracite and has an effective size of 0.55 to 0.65 mm. \item These filters have the problem of losing some carbon during the backwashing; therefore backwashing is properly controlled to prevent the excessive loss of GAC. 
\item Commonly, backwashing causes 1 to 6 percent GAC loss per year.
\item Solids carbon blocks when used in lieu of granular carbon are effective in Cryptosporidium and Giardia removal.

\subsubsection{Math Problems}\index{Math Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item \colorbox{lime}{Filter Flow Rates} – the flow rate expressed in gpm can be calculated from the total flow over certain time or vice-versa can be used for determining either the time it would take to process a certain flow or calculate the total flow.\\

 

 

\textbf{Example 1:}  A filter box is 20 ft by 30 ft (including the sand area). If the influent valve is shut, the water drops 3 inches per minute. What is the rate of filtration in MGD?\\

First let's write down what we are given:\\

 

Filter box = 20 ft x 30 ft Water drops = 3 in/min\\

Area = 20 ft x 30 ft = 600 ft2\\

Answer:  1122 gpm\\

 

 

\textbf{Example 2:}  The flow rate through a filter is 4.25 MGD. What is this flow rate expressed as gpm?\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

$Flow rate, gpm=\dfrac{Flow \enspace rate, \enspace gpd}{1440 \enspace min/day}$\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

Note:  We are assuming that the filter operated uniformly over that 24 hour period.\\

\vspace{0.3cm}

$Flow rate, gpm=\dfrac{4.25 \enspace \dfrac{\cancel{MG}}{\cancel{day}} *1,000,000 \enspace \dfrac{gal}{\cancel{MG}}}{1440\dfrac{min}{\cancel{day}}}=\boxed{2,951 \enspace gpm}$

 

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Example 3:}  At an average flow rate of 4000 gpm, how long of a filter run, in hours, would be required to produce 25 MG of filtered water?\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

$Flow \enspace rate \enspace (gpm)=\dfrac{Total \enspace flow \enspace (gal)}{Filter \enspace run \enspace time \enspace (min)}$

\vspace{0.3cm}

$\implies Filter \enspace run \enspace time \enspace (min)=\dfrac{Total \enspace flow \enspace (gal)}{Flow \enspace rate \enspace (gpm)}$\\

\vspace{0.3cm}

$\implies Filter \enspace run \enspace time \enspace (hr)=25 \enspace MG*\dfrac{1,000,000 \enspace \cancel{gal}}{MG}*\dfrac{\cancel{min}}{4,000 \enspace \cancel{gal}}*60 \enspace \dfrac{hr}{\cancel{min}}=\boxed{104 \enspace hrs}$

 

 

\item \colorbox{lime}{Filtration Rates} – It is the gallons of water filtered per minute through each square foot of filter area.  It generally ranging from 2 to $10 \mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}$.\\

Filtration rate is determined by the following equation:\\
$$
\text { Filtration rate, } \mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}=\frac{\text { Flow rate, } \mathrm{gpm}}{\text { Filter surface area, } \mathrm{ft}^{2}}
$$\\

\textbf{Example 1:} A filter $28 \mathrm{ft}$ long by $18 \mathrm{ft}$ wide treats a flow of $3.5 \mathrm{MGD}$. What is the filtration rate in gpm/ft ${ }^{2}$ ?\\

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textit{Approach:  The flow will need to be converted to gpm and the surface area calculated in feet.}\\

$\text{Filtration rate, } \mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2} = 
\dfrac{
\dfrac{3.5 \enspace \cancel{MG}}{ \cancel{day}} * \dfrac{1,000,000 \enspace gal}{\cancel{MG}}
*\dfrac{\cancel{day}}{1440 \mathrm{ min}}}
{28 \enspace ft * 18 \enspace feet}= \boxed{4.8 \enspace gpm/ft^2}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Example 2:} A filter is $40 \mathrm{ft}$ long by $20 \mathrm{ft}$ wide. During a test of flow rate, the influent valve to the filter is closed for 6 minutes. The water level drop during this period is 16 inches. What is the filtration rate for the filter in $\mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}$ ?\\

\textit{Note:  The volume of the water dropped after the inlet valve was closed would be the filter flow rate.  Since the dimensions to calculate are in feet and inches, the volume needs to be converted from ft$^3$ to gallons}\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\text{Filtration rate, } \mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2} = 
\dfrac{(
40 \mathrm{ ft}*20 \mathrm{ ft} * 16 \mathrm{\cancel{in}}*
\dfrac{ft}{12 \enspace \cancel{in}}
)
\cancel{ft^3}*7.48 \enspace

\item \colorbox{lime}{Backwashing Rates} - is the amount of water, in gallons, required for each backwash. This is analogous to the Filter Flow Rate.

\textbf{Example 1:}
A filter has the following dimensions: $30 \mathrm{ft}$ long by $20 \mathrm{ft}$ wide with a depth of 24 inches of filter media. Assuming that a backwash rate of $15 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{ft}^{2} / \mathrm{min}$ is recommended and 10 minutes of backwash is required, calculate the amount of water, in gallons, required for each backwash.

\textit{The backwashing rate given in $gal/ft^2/min$ will need to be converted into gallons by multiplying it with the area (to eliminate $ft^2$ and by the backwash time in minutes}

$ \text{Backwashing rate (gal)} = 15\dfrac{gal}{\cancel{ft^2}-\cancel{min}}*(30 \mathrm{ ft} \times 20 \mathrm{ ft})\cancel{ft^2}*10 \enspace \cancel{min}=\boxed{90,000 \enspace \text{gal}}$

\item \colorbox{lime}{Backwash Rinse Rates} - it is the upward velocity of the water during backwashing, expressed as in/min rise. To convert from $\mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2}$ backwash rate to an in/min rise rate, use either of the following equations:

$$\text{ Backwash rinse rate, in/} \mathrm{min}=\frac{\text { Backwash rate, } \mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2} \times 12 \mathrm{in} / \mathrm{ft}}{7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}}$$

\textbf{Example:1}
A filter $22 \mathrm{ft}$ long by $12 \mathrm{ft}$ wide has a backwash rate of $3260 \mathrm{gpm}$. What is this backwash rate expressed as a in/min rise?

$$\text{ Backwash rinse rate, in/} \mathrm{min}=\frac{\text { Backwash rate, } \mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2} \times 12 \mathrm{in} / \mathrm{ft}}{7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}}$$

\textit{Based upon the above formula, the Backwash tate in $gpm/ft^2$ needs to be calculated by dividing the gpm flow by the surface area}

$\text{Backwash Rinse Rate, in/} \mathrm{min}=\dfrac{
\Biggl(\dfrac{3260 \mathrm{gpm}}{22 \mathrm{ft} \times 12 \mathrm{ft}}\Biggr) \mathrm{gpm} / \mathrm{ft}^{2} \times 12 \mathrm{in} / \mathrm{ft}
}
{
7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{ft}^{3}
}=\boxed{19.7in/min}$


\item \colorbox{lime}{Percent Product Water Used for Backwashing} - the equation for percent of product water used for backwashing calculations used is:\\
$$
\text { Backwash water, } \%=\frac{\text { Backwash water, gal }}{\text { Water filtered, gal }} \times 100
$$

\textbf{Example:1}
A total of $11,400,000$ gal of water was filtered during a filter run. If backwashing used 48,500 gal of this product water, what percent of the product water is used for backwashing?

Backwash water, $\%=\dfrac{48,500 \text { gal }}{11,400,000 \text { gal }} \times 100 = \boxed{0.43 \%}$

\section{Other Treatment Processes}\index{Other Treatment Processes}
\subsection{Pre-chlorination}\index{Pre-chlorination}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pre-chlorination - chlorine is added to the incoming flow or, instead, added right before filtration.  Benefits of prechlorination include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Elimination of algae and other forms of aquatic life from the water so they won’t cause problems in the later stages of water treatment. 
\item Removal of tastes and odors
\item Control of biological growth throughout the water treatment system, thus preventing growth in the sedimentation tanks (where solids are removed from the water by gravity settling) and the filtration media (the filters through which the water passes after sitting in the sedimentation tanks). 
\item Oxidation of iron, manganese and/or hydrogen sulfide present in the water into a precipitate which can be removed in the sedimentation and filtration steps.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Packed Tower Air Stripping}\index{Packed Tower Air Stripping}
\begin{itemize}
\item Water is sprayed on the top of a packed bed while air is blown at the bottom.
\item The packing provide the interface for the transfer of the contaminants from water into the air phase.
\item Air stripping is for removing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Volatile solids compounds
\item Carbon dioxide
\item Hydrogen sulfide
\item Ammonia
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aeration}\index{Aeration}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the aeration process the water is either pumped up into the air or allowed to fall over an aeration device

\item Aeration as a water treatment practice is used for the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item carbon dioxide reduction (decarbonation)
\item oxidation of iron and manganese found in many well waters (oxidation tower).  During aeration, iron and manganese get oxidized into an insoluble precipitate which is removed during filtration.
\item ammonia and hydrogen sulfide reduction (stripping)
\item Aeration is also an effective method of bacteria control.
\end{itemize}
\item Two general methods may be used for the aeration of water:
\begin{itemize}
\item Water-fall aeration Many variations of the water-fall principle are used for this type of aeration. The simplest configuration employs a vertical riser that discharges water by free fall into a basin.
\item Air diffusion aeration where air is diffused into a receiving vessel containing counter-current flowing water, creating very small air bubbles. This ensures good air-water contact for "scrubbing" of undesirable gases from the water.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Iron and Manganese Sequestration}\index{Iron and Manganese Sequestration}
\begin{itemize}
\item Polyphosphates are used for sequestering iron and magnesium. Sequestration is the addition of chemicals to groundwater aimed at controlling problems caused by iron and manganese without removing them.
\item These chemicals are added to groundwater at the well head or at the pump intake before the water has a chance to come in contact with air or chlorine. This ensures that the iron and manganese stays in a soluble form.
\item If the water contains less than 1.0 mg/L iron and less than 0.3 mg/L manganese, using polyphosphates followed by chlorination can be an effective and inexpensive method for mitigating iron and manganese problems. 
\item No sludge is generated in this method. Below these concentrations, the polyphosphates combine with the iron and manganese preventing them from being oxidized. 
\item Any of the three polyphosphates (pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, or metaphosphate) can be used.
\item Applying sodium silicate and chlorine simultaneously has also been used to sequester iron and manganese. However, while this technique is reliable in the case of iron treatment, it has not been found to be effective in manganese control.  
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Hardness Removal}\index{Hardness Removal}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two common methods used to reduce hardness:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cation exchange:
\begin{itemize}
\item In this process the Calcium (Ca$^{+2}$) and magnesium (Mg$^{+2}$) ions that cause water hardness are replaced or exchanged with with a non-hardness ion like sodium. 
\item The exchange medium can be natural “zeolites” or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand and hold loosley the sodium ions provided by dissolving sodium chloride salt.
\item As hard water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions. 
\item Eventually when the exchange medium becomes coated with calcium and magnesium ions, it must be recharged or regenerated.
\end{itemize}
\item Lime softening
\begin{itemize}
\item Hydrated lime (Ca(OH)$_2$) or quicklime (CaO) is added.  The addition of lime results in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increases the pH of water
\item Reacts with calcium bicarbonate Ca(HCO$_3$)- typically the major source of hardness and converts it to CaCO$_3$
\item As the pH increases further, additional Ca(OH$_2$) will then react with magnesium bicarbonate Mg(HCO$_3$) ultimately converting it to magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH$_2$)
\item Calcium is removed in the 9.0-9.5 pH range and the pH needs to be at least 10.6 to remove magnesium.
\end{itemize}
\item Both CaCO$_3$ and Mg(OH$_2$ have limited solubility in water and precipitate out.  
\item Lime softening is often done in conjunction with coagulation and flocculation.
\item The precipitate formed is separated in the sedimentation tank as sludge.
\item The high pH, softened water produced is corrosive and \textbf{Recarbonation} of the softened water using carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is conducted to lower the pH and thus its corrosivity.  
\item Lime softening produces large quantity of sludge.
\item \textbf{The reaction of Quicklime with water leading to the formation of Ca(OH)$_2$ releases large quantity of heat and is dangerous if left uncontrolled.  Also, Quicklime should never be stored with alum as the water of hydration in alum will react with quicklime causing an explosion}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Softening removes hardness and alkalinity making the product water more corrosive.  
\item It may be necessary to add corrosion-inhibiting materials to the finished water to protect the distribution system and prevent possible simultaneous compliance issues with other regulations like the Lead and Copper Rule.
\item Another option is to bypass a portion of water around the softening process and blending the treated and untreated waters are blended to produce an effluent with a total hardness around 50 to 75 mg/L as CaCO$_3$. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Corrosion Control}\index{Corrosion Control}
\begin{itemize}
\item Corrosion is the gradual deterioration or destruction of metal surfaces by chemical and electrochemical processes.
\item As corrosive water stands or seals in pipes or tanks, it leaches metals from the piping, tanks, well casing, or other metal surfaces that water is in contact.
\item Corrosion can happen both from the inside of pipes and fittings and from the outside - because of the action of the external environment - including soils.
\item Lead and copper in service lines and household plumbing leach into the drinking water because of the corrosivity of water. 
\item Lead is a toxic metal that can be harmful to human health even at low exposure levels. Lead is persistent and can bioaccumulate in the body over time. 
\item The corrosivity of water will depend on the material of construction of the distribution system components and characteristics of water - water is less corrosive at higher pH and alkalinity.
\item Corrosion potential of the water on the distribution system components can be mitigated by chemical treatment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding alkalinity in the form of lime, soda ash, or caustic soda to make the water stable or slightly scale-forming. 
\item Orthophosphates are added to chemically react with lead and copper atoms forming lead and copper phosphate. The lead and copper phosphate is then electrochemically drawn back down onto the piping surface, where it forms a tough, water-resistant coating on the piping. 
\item Silicate compounds added to water also inhibit corrosion by forming a thin protective films on pipe walls.
