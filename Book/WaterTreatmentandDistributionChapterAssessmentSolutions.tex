\begin{enumerate}
\item It takes 6 gallons of chlorine solution to obtain a proper residual when the flow is 45,000 gpd. How many gallons will it take when the flow is 62,000 gpd?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Required gallons of chlorine is directly proportional to the flow being treated.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Thus, $\dfrac{6 \enspace gallons}{45,000 \enspace gpd }=\dfrac{X \enspace gallons}{62,000 \enspace gpd}$
\vspace{0.2cm}

The number of HTH cups/grams and percent solution are directly proportional - more cups/grams are required for a higher percent solution.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Thus, $\dfrac{14 \enspace cups}{12\% \enspace solution }=\dfrac{X \enspace hrs}{5\% \enspace feet}$
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solving for X:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies \enspace X=\dfrac{14*5}{12}=\boxed{5.83 \enspace cups}$

\item Water is flowing at a velocity of $1.3 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$ in a 4.0-in. diameter pipe. If the pipe changes from the 4.0-inch to a 3.0-in. pipe, what will the velocity be in the 3.0-in. pipe?\\
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
This problem is solved here using proportional relationship.  Note:  This is a simpler way of solving compared to the method used to solve the same problem in the Flow - Velocity section.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Q (Flow) = V (Velocity) * A (Area) $\implies V = \dfrac{Q}{A}$
\item As the flow is the same in both - 4 in and 3 in pipes - Q is a constant, V and A are inversely proportional.
\item Therefore, V$_1$*A$_1$=V$_2$*A$_2$
\item As A=$\dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2$
\item As $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ is a constant, V$_1$*D$_1$ $^2$=V$_2$*D$_2$ $^2$ or V$_{4in}$*D${_4in}$ $^2$=V${_3in}$*D${_3in}$ ${^2}$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Practice Problems - Flow and Velocity} \index{Math solutions!Flow and velocity}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Flow in an 8-inch pipe is 500 gpm. What is the average velocity in ft/sec? (Assume pipe is flowing full)\\
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A}) \implies Q=V*A \implies V=\dfrac{Q}{A}$\\
We need to convert Q which is given in gpm to ft${^3}$/sec and calculate the area of the pipe in ft${^2}$ so velocity can be valculated in ft/sec.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$ V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{Q \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{ft}{ft^3}}{sec}}{A \enspace\cancel{ft}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1 - Converting Q - 500 gpm to ft${^3}/min$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\dfrac{500 \enspace \cancel{gallons}}{\bcancel{min}}*\dfrac{ft^3}{7.48 \enspace \cancel{gallon}}*\dfrac{\bcancel{min}}{60 \enspace sec}=1.1\dfrac{ft^3}{sec}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 2 - Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace ft^2= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{8}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{64}{144}=0.349 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{ 1.1 ft^3/sec}{0.349 \enspace ft^2} = \boxed{3.2 ft/sec}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 


\item A pipeline is 18â in diameter and flowing at a velocity of 125 ft. per minute. What is the flow in gallons per minute?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{PipeFlow}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q}) \enspace = Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A})$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
As the velocity is given in ft/min, and the area can be calculated in ft$^2$, flow can be calulated in ft$^3$/min and then converted to gal/min.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1:  Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace (ft^2)= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{18}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{324}{144}=0.349 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

Step 2: Calculate flow in ft$^3$/min:\\

$ Q \enspace ft^3/min = 125 \dfrac{ft}{min}*1.77 \enspace ft^2 = 221.25 \dfrac{ft^3}{min}$\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

Step 3: Convert Q to gallons per minute

\vspace{0.2cm}

$Q=221.25 \dfrac{\cancel{ft^3}}{min}*7.48\dfrac{gal}{\cancel{ft^3}}=\boxed{1655 \dfrac{gal}{min}}$


\item The velocity in a pipeline is 2 ft./sec. and the flow is 3,000 gpm. What is the diameter of the pipe in inches?

Solution:\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{PipeFlow}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}

$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A}) \implies Q=V*A \implies A=\dfrac{Q}{V}$\\
We need to convert Q which is given in gpm to ft${^3}$/sec and calculate the area of the pipe in ft${^2}$ given the velocity.\\
From the calculated area of the pipe, the pipe diameter can be calculated.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$ A \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{Q \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{ft^2}{ft^3}}{\cancel{sec}}}{V \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{}{ft}}{\cancel{sec}}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1 - Converting Q - 3000 gpm to ft${^3}$/sec:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\dfrac{3000 \enspace \cancel{gallons}}{\bcancel{min}}*\dfrac{ft^3}{7.48 \enspace \cancel{gallon}}*\dfrac{\bcancel{min}}{60 \enspace sec}=6.68\dfrac{ft^3}{sec}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 2 - Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies A \enspace ft^2 = \dfrac{ 6.68 ft^3/sec}{2 \dfrac{ft}{sec}} = 3.34 ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
$Area \enspace (A)= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2 = 0.785*D^2 \implies D^2=\dfrac{A}{0.785} \implies D=\Big(\dfrac{A }{0.785}\Big)^{\dfrac{1}{2}}$\\
$\implies D=\Big(\dfrac{3.34}{0.785}\Big)^{\dfrac{1}{2}}=\boxed{2 \enspace ft}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item Find the flow in a 4-inch pipe when the velocity is $1.5$ feet per second.

Solution:\\
$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q}) \enspace = Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A})$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
The velocity is given in ft/sec and after calculating the area in ft$^2$, flow can be calculated in ft$^3$/min.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1:  Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace (ft^2)= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{4}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{324}{144}=0.087 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

Step 2: Calculate flow in ft$^3$/min:\\

$ Q \enspace ft^3/min = 1.5 \dfrac{ft}{sec}*0.087 \enspace ft^2 = 0.13 \dfrac{ft^3}{sec}$\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

Q can be converted to a more commonly used gallons per minute unit

\vspace{0.2cm}

$Q=0.13 \dfrac{\cancel{ft^3}}{sec}*7.48\dfrac{gal}{\cancel{ft^3}}*60\dfrac{sec}{\cancel{min}}=\boxed{59 \dfrac{gal}{min}}$
  

  \item A 42-inch diameter pipe transfers 35 cubic feet of water per second. Find the velocity in $\mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$. 

  Solution:\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{PipeFlow}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}

$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A}) \implies Q=V*A \implies V=\dfrac{Q}{A}$\\
Q is already given in ft${^3}$/sec.  We need to first calculate the area of the pipe in ft${^2}$ so velocity can be valculated in ft/sec.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$ V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{Q \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{ft}{ft^3}}{sec}}{A \enspace\cancel{ft^2}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1 - Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace ft^2= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{42}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{1764}{144}=9.616 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{ 35 ft^3/sec}{9.616 \enspace ft^2} = \boxed{3.6 ft/sec}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 

  
  \item A plastic float is dropped into a channel and is found to travel 10 feet in $4.2$ seconds. The channel is $2.4$ feet wide and the water is flowing $1.8$ feet deep. Calculate the flow rate of water in cfs.\\
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  Solution:\\
  
  \vspace{0.2cm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ChannelFlow3}\\
$Q=V*A \implies V=\dfrac{Q}{A}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
  $Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A})$\\

The speed of the float travelling is the velocity of the water $\implies Velocity = \dfrac{10 \enspace ft}{4.2 \enspace sec}$

Thus flow = $\dfrac{10 \enspace ft}{4.2 \enspace sec} * (2.4*1.8) ft^2 = \boxed{4.32 \dfrac{ft^3}{sec}} $\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

\item A channel is 3.25 feet wide and is conveying a a flow of 3.5 MGD. The depth of the water is 8 inches. Calculate the velocity of this flow.\\
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ChannelFlow3}\\
$Q=V*A \implies V=\dfrac{Q}{A}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
$\implies V\dfrac{ft}{s}=\dfrac{3.5\dfrac{\cancel{MG}}{\cancel{day}}*\dfrac{1000000\cancel{gal}}{\cancel{MG}}*\dfrac{ft^{\cancel{3}}}{7.48\cancel{gal}}*\dfrac{\cancel{day}}{(1440*60)s}}{(3.25*0.75)\cancel{ft^2}}=\boxed{2.2\dfrac{ft}{s}}$

\vspace{0.2cm}

\item Convert 10 gallons/min to $ft^3$/hr\\

\item Find the flow in gpm when the flow is $0.25 \mathrm{cfs}$.\\

\begin{enumerate}

\item In order to disinfect a sedimentation basin measuring $20 \mathrm{ft}$ in width, 60 feet in length, and is 10 feet deep to obtain $50 \mathrm{ppm}$ would require how many lbs. of $65 \%$ available $\mathrm{HTH}$ ?\\
a) $5.0 \mathrm{lbs}$\\
b) $41.3 \mathrm{lbs}$\\
c) $37.4 \mathrm{lbs}$\\
*d) $57.6 \mathrm{lbs}$\\

\item Determine the chlorinator setting (lb/day) required to treat a flow of $4 \mathrm{MGD}$ with a chlorine dose of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$.

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}) \times$ Flow $(\mathrm{MGD}) \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 4 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=167 \mathrm{lb} /$ day

\item A pipeline that is 12 inches in diameter and $1400 \mathrm{ft}$ long is to be treated with a chlorine dose of $48 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$. How many lb of chlorine will this require?

First determine the gallon volume of the pipeline:

Volume $(\mathrm{gal})=0.785 \times \mathrm{D}^{2} \times$ length $(\mathrm{ft}) \times 7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{cu} \mathrm{ft}$

Volume $(\mathrm{gal})=0.785 \times(1 \mathrm{ft})^{2} \times 1400 \mathrm{ft} \times 7.48 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{cu} \mathrm{ft}$ Volume $(\mathrm{gal})=8221 \mathrm{gal}$

Next calculate the amount of chlorine required:

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})$ x Flow $($ MGD) $\times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=48 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 0.008221 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=3.3 \mathrm{lb}$

\item What should the chlorinator seting be (lb/day) to treat a flow of $2.35 \mathrm{MGD}$ if the chlorine demand is $3.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ and a chlorine residual of $0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ is desired?

First, determine the chlorine dosage (in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ):

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=$ Chlorine Demand $+$ Chlorine Residual

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=3.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}+0.9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Chlorine Dose $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})=4.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$

Next calculate the chlorine dosage (feed rate) in $\mathrm{lb} /$ day:

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=$ Chlorine $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}) \times$ Flow $(\mathrm{MGD}) \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=4.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L} \times 2.35 \mathrm{MGD} \times 8.34 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{gal}$

Chlorine feed rate $(\mathrm{lb} /$ day $)=80.4 \mathrm{lb} /$ day
