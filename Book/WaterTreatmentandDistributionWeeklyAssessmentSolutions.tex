\item Flow in an 8-inch pipe is 500 gpm. What is the average velocity in ft/sec? (Assume pipe is flowing full)\\
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A}) \implies Q=V*A \implies V=\dfrac{Q}{A}$\\
We need to convert Q which is given in gpm to ft${^3}$/sec and calculate the area of the pipe in ft${^2}$ so velocity can be valculated in ft/sec.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$ V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{Q \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{ft}{ft^3}}{sec}}{A \enspace\cancel{ft}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1 - Converting Q - 500 gpm to ft${^3}/min$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\dfrac{500 \enspace \cancel{gallons}}{\bcancel{min}}*\dfrac{ft^3}{7.48 \enspace \cancel{gallon}}*\dfrac{\bcancel{min}}{60 \enspace sec}=1.1\dfrac{ft^3}{sec}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 2 - Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace ft^2= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{8}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{64}{144}=0.349 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{ 1.1 ft^3/sec}{0.349 \enspace ft^2} = \boxed{3.2 ft/sec}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 


\item A pipeline is 18â in diameter and flowing at a velocity of 125 ft. per minute. What is the flow in gallons per minute?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q}) \enspace = Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A})$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
As the velocity is given in ft/min, and the area can be calculated in ft$^2$, flow can be calulated in ft$^3$/min and then converted to gal/min.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1:  Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace (ft^2)= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{18}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{324}{144}=0.349 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

Step 2: Calculate flow in ft$^3$/min:\\

$ Q \enspace ft^3/min = 125 \dfrac{ft}{min}*1.77 \enspace ft^2 = 221.25 \dfrac{ft^3}{min}$\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

Step 3: Convert Q to gallons per minute

\vspace{0.2cm}

$Q=221.25 \dfrac{\cancel{ft^3}}{min}*7.48\dfrac{gal}{\cancel{ft^3}}=\boxed{1655 \dfrac{gal}{min}}$


\item The velocity in a pipeline is 2 ft./sec. and the flow is 3,000 gpm. What is the diameter of the pipe in inches?

Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A}) \implies Q=V*A \implies A=\dfrac{Q}{V}$\\
We need to convert Q which is given in gpm to ft${^3}$/sec and calculate the area of the pipe in ft${^2}$ given the velocity.\\
From the calculated area of the pipe, the pipe diameter can be calculated.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$ A \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{Q \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{ft^2}{ft^3}}{\cancel{sec}}}{V \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{}{ft}}{\cancel{sec}}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1 - Converting Q - 3000 gpm to ft${^3}$/sec:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\dfrac{3000 \enspace \cancel{gallons}}{\bcancel{min}}*\dfrac{ft^3}{7.48 \enspace \cancel{gallon}}*\dfrac{\bcancel{min}}{60 \enspace sec}=6.68\dfrac{ft^3}{sec}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 2 - Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies A \enspace ft^2 = \dfrac{ 6.68 ft^3/sec}{2 \dfrac{ft}{sec}} = 3.34 ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 
$Area \enspace (A)= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2 = 0.785*D^2 \implies D^2=\dfrac{A}{0.785} \implies D=\Big(\dfrac{A }{0.785}\Big)^{\dfrac{1}{2}}$\\
$\implies D=\Big(\dfrac{3.34}{0.785}\Big)^{\dfrac{1}{2}}=\boxed{2 \enspace ft}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item Find the flow in a 4-inch pipe when the velocity is $1.5$ feet per second.

Solution:\\
$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q}) \enspace = Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A})$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
The velocity is given in ft/sec and after calculating the area in ft$^2$, flow can be calulated in ft$^3$/min.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1:  Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace (ft^2)= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{4}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{324}{144}=0.087 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

Step 2: Calculate flow in ft$^3$/min:\\

$ Q \enspace ft^3/min = 1.5 \dfrac{ft}{sec}*0.087 \enspace ft^2 = 0.13 \dfrac{ft^3}{sec}$\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

Q can be converted to a more commonly used gallons per minute unit

\vspace{0.2cm}

$Q=0.13 \dfrac{\cancel{ft^3}}{sec}*7.48\dfrac{gal}{\cancel{ft^3}}*60\dfrac{sec}{\cancel{min}}=\boxed{59 \dfrac{gal}{min}}$
  \item A 42-inch diameter pipe transfers 35 cubic feet of water per second. Find the velocity in $\mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}$. 

  Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

$Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A}) \implies Q=V*A \implies V=\dfrac{Q}{A}$\\
Q is already given in ft${^3}$/sec.  We need to first calculate the area of the pipe in ft${^2}$ so velocity can be valculated in ft/sec.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$ V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{Q \enspace \dfrac{\cancelto{ft}{ft^3}}{sec}}{A \enspace\cancel{ft}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Step 1 - Calculating area in ft${^2}$:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$Area \enspace ft^2= \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2= 0.785*\Big(\dfrac{42}{12}\Big)^2 \enspace ft^2=0.785*\dfrac{1764}{144}=9.616 \enspace ft^2$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$\implies V \dfrac{ft}{sec} = \dfrac{ 35 ft^3/sec}{9.616 \enspace ft^2} = \boxed{3.6 ft/sec}$\\
\vspace{0.3cm} 

  
  \item A plastic float is dropped into a channel and is found to travel 10 feet in $4.2$ seconds. The channel is $2.4$ feet wide and the water is flowing $1.8$ feet deep. Calculate the flow rate of water in cfs.\\
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  Solution:\\
  $Flow \enspace(\mathrm{Q})= Velocity \enspace(\mathrm{V})  \times Area \enspace(\mathrm{A})$\\

The speed of the float travelling is the velocity of the water $\implies Velocity = \dfrac{10 \enspace ft}{4.2 \enspace sec}$

Thus flow = $\dfrac{10 \enspace ft}{4.2 \enspace sec} * (2.4*1.8) ft^2 = \boxed{4.32 \dfrac{ft^3}{sec}} $\\

\vspace{0.2cm}

\item $25 \%$ of the chlorine in a 30-gallon vat has been used. How many gallons are remaining in the vat?\\

\item The annual public works budget is $\$ 147,450$. If $75 \%$ of the budget should be spent by the end of September, how many dollars are to be spent? How many dollars will be remaining?\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
Amount to be spent = \$147,450*0.75 = $\boxed{\$110,812.50}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Amount remaining = \$ 147,450 - 110,812.50 = $\boxed{\$36,367.50}$

\item A 75 pound container of calcium hypochlorite has a purity of $67 \%$. What is the actual weight of the calcium hypochlorite in the container? \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
Note: Calcium Hypochlorite can be written as Ca(OCl)$_2$\\
$75 \enspace lbs \enspace Ca(OCl)_2 \enspace - \enspace product \enspace in \enspace container*\dfrac{0.67 \enspace lbs \enspace Ca(OCl)_2 }{lb \enspace Ca(OCl)_2  \enspace - \enspace product \enspace in \enspace container} = \boxed{50.25 \enspace lbs \enspace Ca(OCl)_2}$\\

\item A 60-foot diameter tank contains 422,000 gallons of water. Calculate the height of water in the storage tank.

Volume = Area * Height $\implies Height (ft) =\dfrac{Volume - \cancelto{ft}{ft^3}}{Area \cancel{ft^2}}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\

$ Volume \enspace (ft^3) = \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2 * fill height = 0.785*17.5^2 \enspace ft^2 * 14 ft=\boxed{240\enspace ft^3}$


\item What is the volume of water in ft$^3$, of a sedimentation basin that is 22 feet long, and 15 feet wide, and filled to 10 feet?\\

Volume = Length * Width * Height = 22 ft * 15 ft * 10 ft = $\boxed{3300 \enspace ft^3}$\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
$ Volume \enspace (ft^3) = \dfrac{\pi}{4}*D^2 * fill \enspace height = 0.785*17.5^2 \enspace ft^2 * 14 ft=\boxed{240\enspace ft^3}$

\item What is the volume in ft$^3$ of an elevated clear well that is 17.5 feet in diameter, and filled to 14 feet?

Volume = Area * Height\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Required gallons of chlorine is directly proportional to the flow being treated.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Thus, $\dfrac{6 \enspace gallons}{45,000 \enspace gpd }=\dfrac{X \enspace gallons}{62,000 \enspace gpd}$
\vspace{0.2cm}
Solving for X:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

$\boxed{50ft}$


\vspace{0.2cm}
\item Calculate drawdown, in feet, using the following data:\\
The water level in a well is 20 feet below the ground surface when the pump is not in operation, and the water level is 35 feet below the ground surface when the pump is in operation.\\
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

  $\text {Drawdown} = 35 \mathrm{ft}-20 \mathrm{ft}=\boxed{15ft}$\\


\vspace{0.2cm}
\item Calculate the well yield in gpm, given a drawdown of 14.1 ft and a specific yield of 31 gpm/ft.\\
Solution:\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
  $Specific \enspace Yield \enspace(gpm/ft) =\dfrac{ Yield \enspace(gpm)}{ Drawdown \enspace(ft)}$\\
  \vspace{0.2cm}

  $\implies Yield \enspace(gpm) = Specific \enspace Yield \enspace(gpm/ft)*Drawdown \enspace(ft)=31*14.1=\boxed{437.1 \enspace gpm}$
