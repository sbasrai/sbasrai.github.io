CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
 A force associated with a rotating body. In the case of a pump, the rotating impeller pushes fluid on the back of the impeller blade, imparting motion. Since the motion is circular there is a centrifugal force associated with it. The force pushes the fluid against a fixed pump casing thereby pressurizing the fluid and forcing it through the outlet.

CENTRIFUGAL PUMP
 Centrifugal pumps are the most common type of pump in use today throughout the world. A centrifugal pump is a rotodynamic pump that uses a rotating impeller to increase the velocity of a fluid. Centrifugal pumps are commonly used to move liquids through a piping system. The fluid enters the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated by the impeller, flowing radially outward into a diffuser or volute chamber, from there it exits into the downstream piping system. A centrifugal pump works by the conversion of the rotational kinetic energy, typically from an electric motor or engine, to an increased static fluid pressure. This action is described by Bernoulli’s principle. The rotation of the pump impeller imparts kinetic energy to the fluid as it is drawn in from the impeller eye (center) and is forced outward through the impeller vanes to the periphery. As the fluid exits the impeller, the fluid kinetic energy (velocity) is then converted to (static) pressure due to the change in area the fluid experiences in the volute section. Typically, the volute shape of the pump casing (increasing in volume), or the diffuser vanes (which serve to slow the fluid, converting to kinetic energy in to flow) are responsible for the energy conversion. The energy conversion results in an increased pressure on the downstream side of the pump, causing flow.

CHOPPER PUMP
 A chopper pump is a centrifugal pump, which is equipped with a cutting system to facilitate chopping/maceration of solids that are present in the pumped liquid.

Chopper pumps exist in various configurations, including submersible and dry-installed design and they are typically equipped with an electric motor to run the impeller and to provide torque for the chopping system.

PRIMING PUMP
 Self-priming pumps are centrifugal pumps with an abnormally large and specially shaped volute. The purpose of the large volute is to allow the pump to pull or “lift” liquid up to the impeller. Initially the pump volute (casing), must be filled with liquid manually to “pre-prime” the pump. As the pump starts it pumps out the liquid that was manually put into it while also drawing up the air in the suction pipe along with pulling up the liquid to be pumped. As the lifted liquid enters the volute the final volume of air is pumped out of the discharge and through an air release valve. Once the liquid hits the air valve, it closes and the pump now operates as a standard centrifugal pump.

SURCHARGE
Sewers are surcharged when the supply of water to be carried is greater than the capacity of the pipes to carry the flow. The surface of the wastewater in manholes rises above the top of the sewer pipe, and the sewer is under pressure or a head, rather than at atmospheric pressure. 

SURCHARGED MANHOLE

Northern climates require lower loading rates than warmer areas, because cold weather slows down the stabilization processes of microorganisms. Treatment plants clarifiers are rated hydraulically in flow (gpd) per surface area (sq ft).

***TERTIARY WASTE TREATMENT
 Following secondary treatment, the clarified effluent may require additional aeration and/or other chemical treatment to destroy bacteria remaining from the secondary treating stage, and to increase the content of dissolved oxygen needed for oxidation of the residual BOD. Tertiary treatment can also be used to remove nitrogen and phosphorous. This is done with clorination and often times UV treatment.

TORQUE SWITCH
 An electrical device on a motor operator which cuts off power to the operator when allowable torque is exceeded, thus preventing damage to the valve and/or the operator.

The spring in a check valve slam retarder which is restrained at one end and fastened tot he clappershaft on the other end. As the clapper opens, the spring resists the motion creating a closing force. During a rapid decrease in flow rate, the clapper is urged toward the closed position and is virtually closed just prior to the instant of actual flow reversal - thus slamming is avoided.

TOTAL DISSOLVED SOLIDS

 An aerobic biological process used as secondary treatment of sewage. Effluent from the primary clarifier is distributed over a bed of rocks. As the liquid trickles over the rocks, a biological growth on the rocks breaks down the organic matter in the sewage. The effluent is then taken to a clarifier to remove biological matter coming from the filter.

With the line valve closed (and under pressure) the body cavity pressurecan be vented thru this small valve to check tightness of seat seals or to make minor repairs. Having vented the body pressure, the vent plug may be removed to blow out debris and foreign material or to flush the body cavity. On some gate valves, the vent plug is installed on the bonnet for the sole purpose of venting the body. Such valves have separate drain valves.

VENTURI VALVE
 A reduced bore valve. A valve having a bore smaller in diameter than the inlet or outlet. For example, an 8"x 6" x 8" ball valve has 8" inlet and outlet connections while the ball and seats are 6". The flow through a venture valve will be reduced because of the smaller port. Venturi valves can often be economically substituted for plug valves.
